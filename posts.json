The suffering and death that are occurring there now are not inevitable, not unavoidable in any fatalistic sense of the term. Constant poverty, a cyclone, and a civil war have turned at least nine million people into destitute refugees; nevertheless, it is not beyond the capacity of the richer nations to give enough assistance to reduce any further suffering to very small proportions. The decisions and actions of human beings can prevent this kind of suffering. Unfortunately, human beings have not made the necessary decisions. At the individual level, people have, with very few exceptions, not responded to the situation in any significant way. Generally speaking, people have not given large sums to relief funds; they have not written to their parliamentary representatives demanding increased government assistance; they have not demonstrated in the streets, held symbolic fasts, or done anything else directed toward providing the refugees with the means to satisfy their essential needs. At the government level, no government has given the sort of massive aid that would enable the refugees to survive for more than a few days. Britain, for instance, has given rather more than most countries. It has, to date, given £14,750,000. For comparative purposes, Britain's share of the nonrecoverable development costs of the Anglo-French Concorde project is already in excess of £275,000,000, and on present estimates will reach £440,000,000. The implication is that the British government values a supersonic transport more than thirty times as highly as it values the lives of the 9 million refugees. Australia is another country which, on a per capita basis, is well up in the \"aid to Bengal\" table. Australia's aid, however, amounts to less than one-twelfth of the cost of Sydney's new opera house. The total amount given, from all sources, now stands at about £65,000,000. The estimated cost of keeping the refugees alive for one year is £464,000,000. Most of the refugees have now been in the camps for more than six months. The World Bank has said that India needs a minimum of £300,000,000 in assistance from other countries before the end of the year. It seems obvious that assistance on this scale will not be forthcoming. India will be forced to choose between letting the refugees starve or diverting funds from her own development program, which will mean that more of her own people will starve in the future.</p>\n<p>These are the essential facts about the present situation in Bengal. So far as it concerns us here, there is nothing unique about this situation except its magnitude. The Bengal emergency is just the latest and most acute of a series of major emergencies in various parts of the world, arising both from natural and from man-made causes. There are also many parts of the world in which people die from malnutrition and lack of food independent of any special emergency. I take Bengal as my example only because it is the present concern, and because the size of the problem has ensured that it has been given adequate publicity. Neither individuals nor governments can claim to be unaware of what is happening there.</p>\n<p>What are the moral implications of a situation like this? In what follows, I shall argue that the way people in relatively affluent countries react to a situation like that in Bengal cannot be justified; indeed, the whole way we look at moral issues—our moral conceptual scheme—needs to be altered, and with it, the way of life that has come to be taken for granted in our society.</p>\n<p>In arguing for this conclusion I will not, of course, claim to be morally neutral. I shall, however, try to argue for the moral position that I take, so that anyone who accepts certain assumptions, to be made explicit, will, I hope, accept my conclusion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I begin with the assumption that suffering and death from lack of food, shelter, and medical care are bad. I think most people will agree about this, although one may reach the same view by different routes. I shall not argue for this view. People can hold all sorts of eccentric positions, and perhaps from some of them it would not follow that death by starvation is in itself bad. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to refute such positions, and so for brevity I will henceforth take this assumption as accepted. Those who disagree need read no further.</p>\n<p>My next point is this: If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it. By \"without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance\" I mean without causing anything else comparably bad to happen, or doing something that is wrong in itself, or failing to promote some moral good, comparable in significance to the bad thing that we can prevent. This principle seems almost as uncontroversial as the last one. It requires us only to prevent what is bad, and not to promote what is good, and it requires this of us only when we can do it without sacrificing anything that is, from the moral point of view, comparably important. I could even, as far as the application of my argument to the Bengal emergency is concerned, qualify the point so as to make it: If it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it. An application of this principle would be as follows: If I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad thing.</p>\n<p>The uncontroversial appearance of the principle just stated is deceptive. If it were acted upon, even in its qualified form, our lives, our society, and our world would be fundamentally changed. For the principle takes, firstly, no account of proximity or distance. It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. Secondly, the principle makes no distinction between cases in which I am the only person who could possibly do anything and cases in which I am just one among millions in the same position.</p>\n<p>I do not think I need to say much in defense of the refusal to take proximity and distance into account. The fact that a person is physically near to us, so that we have personal contact with him, may make it more likely that we <em>shall</em> assist him, but this does not show that we <em>ought</em> to help him rather than another who happens to be further away. If we accept any principle of impartiality, universalizability, equality, or whatever, we cannot discriminate against someone merely because he is far away from us (or we are far away from him). Admittedly, it is possible that we are in a better position to judge what needs to be done to help a person near to us than one far away, and perhaps also to provide the assistance we judge to be necessary. If this were the case, it would be a reason for helping those near to us first. This may once have been a justification for being more concerned with the poor in one's own town than with famine victims in India. Unfortunately for those who like to keep their moral responsibilities limited, instant communication and swift transportation have changed the situation. From the moral point of view, the development of the world into a \"global village\" has made an important, though still unrecognized, difference to our moral situation. Expert observers and supervisors, sent out by famine relief organizations or permanently stationed in famine-prone areas, can direct our aid to a refugee in Bengal almost as effectively as we could get it to someone in our own block. There would seem, therefore, to be no possible justification for discriminating on geographical grounds.</p>\n<p>There may be a greater need to defend the second implication of my principle—that the fact that there are millions of other people in the same position, in respect to the Bengali refugees, as I am, does not make the situation significantly different from a situation in which I am the only person who can prevent something very bad from occurring. Again, of course, I admit that there is a psychological difference between the cases; one feels less guilty about doing nothing if one can point to others, similarly placed, who have also done nothing. Yet this can make no real difference to our moral obligations. Should I consider that I am less obliged to pull the drowning child out of the pond if on looking around I see other people, no further away than I am, who have also noticed the child but are doing nothing? One has only to ask this question to see the absurdity of the view that numbers lessen obligation. It is a view that is an ideal excuse for inactivity; unfortunately most of the major evils—poverty, overpopulation, pollution—are problems in which everyone is almost equally involved.</p>\n<p>The view that numbers do make a difference can be made plausible if stated in this way: If everyone in circumstances like mine gave £5 to the Bengal Relief Fund, there would be enough to provide food, shelter, and medical care for the refugees; there is no reason why I should give more than anyone else in the same circumstances as I am; therefore I have no obligation to give more than £5. Each premise in this argument is true, and the argument looks sound. It may convince us, unless we notice that it is based on a hypothetical premise, although the conclusion is not stated hypothetically. The argument would be sound if the conclusion were: If everyone in circumstances like mine were to give £5, I would have no obligation to give more than £5. If the conclusion were so stated, however, it would be obvious that the argument has no bearing on a situation in which it is not the case that everyone else gives £5. This, of course, is the actual situation. It is more or less certain that not everyone in circumstances like mine will give £5. So there will not be enough to provide the needed food, shelter, and medical care. Therefore by giving more than £5 I will prevent more suffering than I would if I gave just £5.</p>\n<p>It might be thought that this argument has an absurd consequence. Since the situation appears to be that very few people are likely to give substantial amounts, it follows that I and everyone else in similar circumstances ought to give as much as possible, that is, at least up to the point at which by giving more one would begin to cause serious suffering for oneself and one's dependents—perhaps even beyond this point to the point of marginal utility, at which by giving more one would cause oneself and one's dependents as much suffering as one would prevent in Bengal. If everyone does this, however, there will be more than can be used for the benefit of the refugees, and some of the sacrifice will have been unnecessary. Thus, if everyone does what he ought to do, the result will not be as good as it would be if everyone did a little less than he ought to do, or if only some do all that they ought to do.</p>\n<p>The paradox here arises only if we assume that the actions in question—sending money to the relief funds—are performed more or less simultaneously, and are also unexpected. For if it is to be expected that everyone is going to contribute something, then clearly each is not obliged to give as much as he would have been obliged to had others not been giving too. And if everyone is not acting more or less simultaneously, then those giving later will know how much more is needed, and will have no obligation to give more than is necessary to reach this amount. To say this is not to deny the principle that people in the same circumstances have the same obligations, but to point out that the fact that others have given, or may be expected to give, is a relevant circumstance: Those giving after it has become known that many others are giving and those giving before are not in the same circumstances. So the seemingly absurd consequence of the principle I have put forward can occur only if people are in error about the actual circumstances—that is, if they think they are giving when others are not, but in fact they are giving when others are. The result of everyone doing what he really ought to do cannot be worse than the result of everyone doing less than he ought to do, although the result of everyone doing what he reasonably believes he ought to do could be.</p>\n<p>If my argument so far has been sound, neither our distance from a preventable evil nor the number of other people who, in respect to that evil, are in the same situation as we are, lessens our obligation to mitigate or prevent that evil. I shall therefore take as established the principle I asserted earlier. As I have already said, I need to assert it only in its qualified form: If it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything else morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it.</p>\n<p>The outcome of this argument is that our traditional moral categories are upset. The traditional distinction between duty and charity cannot be drawn, or at least, not in the place we normally draw it. Giving money to the Bengal Relief Fund is regarded as an act of charity in our society. The bodies which collect money are known as \"charities.\" These organizations see themselves in this way—if you send them a check, you will be thanked for your \"generosity.\" Because giving money is regarded as an act of charity, it is not thought that there is anything wrong with not giving. The charitable man may be praised, but the man who is not charitable is not condemned. People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new clothes or a new car instead of giving it to famine relief. (Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.) This way of looking at the matter cannot be justified. When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves warm but to look \"well-dressed\" we are not providing for any important need. We would not be sacrificing anything significant if we were to continue to wear our old clothes, and give the money to famine relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another person from starving. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need to keep us warm. To do so is not charitable, or generous. Nor is it the kind of act which philosophers and theologians have called \"supererogatory\"—an act which it would be good to do, but not wrong not to do. On the contrary, we ought to give the money away, and it is wrong not to do so.</p>\n<p>I am not maintaining that there are no acts which are charitable, or that there are no acts which it would be good to do but not wrong not to do. It may be possible to redraw the distinction between duty and charity in some other place. All I am arguing here is that the present way of drawing the distinction, which makes it an act of charity for a man living at the level of affluence which most people in the \"developed nations\" enjoy to give money to save someone else from starvation, cannot be supported. It is beyond the scope of my argument to consider whether the distinction should be redrawn or abolished altogether. There would be many other possible ways of drawing the distinction—for instance, one might decide that it is good to make other people as happy as possible, but not wrong not to do so.</p>\n<p>Despite the limited nature of the revision in our moral conceptual scheme which I am proposing, the revision would, given the extent of both affluence and famine in the world today, have radical implications. These implications may lead to further objections, distinct from those I have already considered. I shall discuss two of these.</p>\n<p>One objection to the position I have taken might be simply that it is too drastic a revision of our moral scheme. People do not ordinarily judge in the way I have suggested they should. Most people reserve their moral condemnation for those who violate some moral norm, such as the norm against taking another person's property. They do not condemn those who indulge in luxury instead of giving to famine relief. But given that I did not set out to present a morally neutral description of the way people make moral judgments, the way people do in fact judge has nothing to do with the validity of my conclusion. My conclusion follows from the principle which I advanced earlier, and unless that principle is rejected, or the arguments shown to be unsound, I think the conclusion must stand, however strange it appears.</p>\n<p>It might, nevertheless, be interesting to consider why our society, and most other societies, do judge differently from the way I have suggested they should. In a well-known article, J. O. Urmson suggests that the imperatives of duty, which tell us what we must do, as distinct from what it would be good to do but not wrong not to do, function so as to prohibit behavior that is intolerable if men are to live together in society. This may explain the origin and continued existence of the present division between acts of duty and acts of charity. Moral attitudes are shaped by the needs of society, and no doubt society needs people who will observe the rules that make social existence tolerable. From the point of view of a particular society, it is essential to prevent violations of norms against killing, stealing, and so on. It is quite inessential, however, to help people outside one's own society.</p>\n<p>If this is an explanation of our common distinction between duty and supererogation, however, it is not a justification of it. The moral point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own society. Previously, as I have already mentioned, this may hardly have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property norms within our society.</p>\n<p>It has been argued by some writers, among them Sidgwick and Urmson, that we need to have a basic moral code which is not too far beyond the capacities of the ordinary man, for otherwise there will be a general breakdown of compliance with the moral code. Crudely stated, this argument suggests that if we tell people that they ought to refrain from murder and give everything they do not really need to famine relief, they will do neither, whereas if we tell them that they ought to refrain from murder and that it is good to give to famine relief but not wrong not to do so, they will at least refrain from murder. The issue here is: Where should we draw the line between conduct that is required and conduct that is good although not required, so as to get the best possible result? This would seem to be an empirical question, although a very difficult one. One objection to the Sidgwick-Urmson line of argument is that it takes insufficient account of the effect that moral standards can have on the decisions we make. Given a society in which a wealthy man who gives 5 percent of his income to famine relief is regarded as most generous, it is not surprising that a proposal that we all ought to give away half our incomes will be thought to be absurdly unrealistic. In a society which held that no man should have more than enough while others have less than they need, such a proposal might seem narrow-minded. What it is possible for a man to do and what he is likely to do are both, I think, very greatly influenced by what people around him are doing and expecting him to do. In any case, the possibility that by spreading the idea that we ought to be doing very much more than we are to relieve famine we shall bring about a general breakdown of moral behavior seems remote. If the stakes are an end to widespread starvation, it is worth the risk. Finally, it should be emphasized that these considerations are relevant only to the issue of what we should require from others, and not to what we ourselves ought to do.</p>\n<p>The second objection to my attack on the present distinction between duty and charity is one which has from time to time been made against utilitarianism. It follows from some forms of utilitarian theory that we all ought, morally, to be working full time to increase the balance of happiness over misery. The position I have taken here would not lead to this conclusion in all circumstances, for if there were no bad occurrences that we could prevent without sacrificing something of comparable moral importance, my argument would have no application. Given the present conditions in many parts of the world, however, it does follow from my argument that we ought, morally, to be working full time to relieve great suffering of the sort that occurs as a result of famine or other disasters. Of course, mitigating circumstances can be adduced—for instance, that if we wear ourselves out through overwork, we shall be less effective than we would otherwise have been. Nevertheless, when all considerations of this sort have been taken into account, the conclusion remains: We ought to be preventing as much suffering as we can without sacrificing something else of comparable moral importance. This conclusion is one which we may be reluctant to face. I cannot see, though, why it should be regarded as a criticism of the position for which I have argued, rather than a criticism of our ordinary standards of behavior. Since most people are self–interested to some degree, very few of us are likely to do everything that we ought to do. It would, however, hardly be honest to take this as evidence that it is not the case that we ought to do it.</p>\n<p>It may still be thought that my conclusions are so wildly out of line with what everyone else thinks and has always thought that there must be something wrong with the argument somewhere. In order to show that my conclusions, while certainly contrary to contemporary Western moral standards, would not have seemed so extraordinary at other times and in other places, I would like to quote a passage from a writer not normally thought of as a way-out radical, Thomas Aquinas.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now, according to the natural order instituted by divine providence, material goods are provided for the satisfaction of human needs. Therefore the division and appropriation of property, which proceeds from human law, must not hinder the satisfaction of man's necessity from such goods. Equally, whatever a man has in superabundance is owed, of natural right, to the poor for their sustenance. So Ambrosius says, and it is also to be found in the <em>Decretum Gratiani</em>: \"The bread which you withhold belongs to the hungry; the clothing you shut away, to the naked; and the money you bury in the earth is the redemption and freedom of the penniless.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I now want to consider a number of points, more practical than philosophical, which are relevant to the application of the moral conclusion we have reached. These points challenge not the idea that we ought to be doing all we can to prevent starvation, but the idea that giving away a great deal of money is the best means to this end.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is sometimes said that overseas aid should be a government responsibility, and that therefore one ought not to give to privately run charities. Giving privately, it is said, allows the government and the noncontributing members of society to escape their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>This argument seems to assume that the more people there are who give to privately organized famine relief funds, the less likely it is that the government will take over full responsibility for such aid. This assumption is unsupported, and does not strike me as at all plausible. The opposite view—that if no one gives voluntarily, a government will assume that its citizens are uninterested in famine relief and would not wish to be forced into giving aid—seems more plausible. In any case, unless there were a definite probability that by refusing to give one would be helping to bring about massive government assistance, people who do refuse to make voluntary contributions are refusing to prevent a certain amount of suffering without being able to point to any tangible beneficial consequence of their refusal. So the onus of showing how their refusal will bring about government action is on those who refuse to give.</p>\n<p>I do not, of course, want to dispute the contention that governments of affluent nations should be giving many times the amount of genuine, no-strings-attached aid that they are giving now. I agree, too, that giving privately is not enough, and that we ought to be campaigning actively for entirely new standards for both public and private contributions to famine relief. Indeed, I would sympathize with someone who thought that campaigning was more important than giving oneself, although I doubt whether preaching what one does not practice would be very effective. Unfortunately, for many people the idea that \"it's the government's responsibility\" is a reason for not giving which does not appear to entail any political action either.</p>\n<p>Another, more serious reason for not giving to famine relief funds is that until there is effective population control, relieving famine merely postpones starvation. If we save the Bengal refugees now, others, per haps the children of these refugees, will face starvation in a few years' time. In support of this, one may cite the now well-known facts about the population explosion and the relatively limited scope for expanded production.</p>\n<p>This point, like the previous one, is an argument against relieving suffering that is happening now, because of a belief about what might happen in the future; it is unlike the previous point in that very good evidence can be adduced in support of this belief about the future. I will not go into the evidence here. I accept that the earth cannot support indefinitely a population rising at the present rate. This certainly poses a problem for anyone who thinks it important to prevent famine. Again, however, one could accept the argument without drawing the conclusion that it absolves one from any obligation to do anything to prevent famine. The conclusion that should be drawn is that the best means of preventing famine, in the long run, is population control. It would then follow from the position reached earlier that one ought to be doing all one can to promote population control (unless one held that all forms of population control were wrong in themselves, or would have significantly bad consequences). Since there are organizations working specifically for population control, one would then support them rather than more orthodox methods of preventing famine.</p>\n<p>A third point raised by the conclusion reached earlier relates to the question of just how much we all ought to be giving away. One possibility, which has already been mentioned, is that we ought to give until we reach the level of marginal utility—that is, the level at which, by giving more, I would cause as much suffering to myself or my dependents as I would relieve by my gift. This would mean, of course, that one would reduce oneself to very near the material circumstances of a Bengali refugee. It will be recalled that earlier I put forward both a strong and a moderate version of the principle of preventing bad occurrences. The strong version, which required us to prevent bad things from happening unless in doing so we would be sacrificing something of comparable moral significance, does seem to require reducing ourselves to the level of marginal utility. I should also say that the strong version seems to me to be the correct one. I proposed the more moderate version—that we should prevent bad occurrences unless, to do so, we had to sacrifice something morally significant—only in order to show that even on this surely undeniable principle a great change in our way of life is required. On the more moderate principle, it may not follow that we ought to reduce ourselves to the level of marginal utility, for one might hold that to reduce oneself and one's family to this level is to cause something significantly bad to happen. Whether this is so I shall not discuss, since, as I have said, I can see no good reason for holding the moderate version of the principle rather than the strong version. Even if we accepted the principle only in its moderate form, however, it should be clear that we would have to give away enough to ensure that the consumer society, dependent as it is on people spending on trivia rather than giving to famine relief, would slow down and perhaps disappear entirely. There are several reasons why this would be desirable in itself. The value and necessity of economic growth are now being questioned not only by conservationists, but by economists as well. There is no doubt, too, that the consumer society has had a distorting effect on the goals and purposes of its members. Yet looking at the matter purely from the point of view of overseas aid, there must be a limit to the extent to which we should deliberately slow down our economy; for it might be the case that if we gave away, say, 40 percent of our Gross National Product, we would slow down the economy so much that in absolute terms we would be giving less than if we gave 25 percent of the much larger GNP that we would have if we limited our contribution to this smaller percentage.</p>\n<p>I mention this only as an indication of the sort of factor that one would have to take into account in working out an ideal. Since Western societies generally consider 1 percent of the GNP an acceptable level for overseas aid, the matter is entirely academic. Nor does it affect the question of how much an individual should give in a society in which very few are giving substantial amounts.</p>\n<p>It is sometimes said, though less often now than it used to be, that philosophers have no special role to play in public affairs, since most public issues depend primarily on an assessment of facts. On questions of fact, it is said, philosophers as such have no special expertise, and so it has been possible to engage in philosophy without committing oneself to any position on major public issues. No doubt there are some issues of social policy and foreign policy about which it can truly be said that a really expert assessment of the facts is required before taking sides or acting, but the issue of famine is surely not one of these. The facts about the existence of suffering are beyond dispute. Nor, I think, is it disputed that we can do something about it, either through orthodox methods of famine relief or through population control or both. This is therefore an issue on which philosophers are competent to take a position. The issue is one which faces everyone who has more money than he needs to support himself and his dependents, or who is in a position to take some sort of political action. These categories must include practically every teacher and student of philosophy in the universities of the Western world. If philosophy is to deal with matters that are relevant to both teachers and students, this is an issue that philosophers should discuss.</p>\n<p>Discussion, though, is not enough. What is the point of relating philosophy to public (and personal) affairs if we do not take our conclusions seriously? In this instance, taking our conclusion seriously means acting upon it. The philosopher will not find it any easier than anyone else to alter his attitudes and way of life to the extent that, if I am right, is involved in doing everything that we ought to be doing. At the very least, though, one can make a start.

The dragon stood taller than the largest cathedral, and it was covered with thick black scales. Its red eyes glowed with hate, and from its terrible jaws flowed an incessant stream of evil-smelling yellowish-green slime. It demanded from humankind a blood-curdling tribute: to satisfy its enormous appetite, ten thousand men and women had to be delivered every evening at the onset of dark to the foot of the mountain where the dragon-tyrant lived. Sometimes the dragon would devour these unfortunate souls upon arrival; sometimes again it would lock them up in the mountain where they would wither away for months or years before eventually being consumed.</p>\n<p>The misery inflicted by the dragon-tyrant was incalculable. In addition to the ten thousand who were gruesomely slaughtered each day, there were the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, children, and friends that were left behind to grieve the loss of their departed loved ones.</p>\n<p>Some people tried to fight the dragon, but whether they were brave or foolish was difficult to say. Priests and magicians called down curses, to no avail. Warriors, armed with roaring courage and the best weapons the smiths could produce, attacked it, but were incinerated by its fire before coming close enough to strike. Chemists concocted toxic brews and tricked the dragon into swallowing them, but the only apparent effect was to further stimulate its appetite. The dragon’s claws, jaws, and fire were so effective, its scaly armor so impregnable, and its whole nature so robust, as to make it invincible to any human assault.</p>\n<p>Seeing that defeating the tyrant was impossible, humans had no choice but to obey its commands and pay the grisly tribute. The fatalities selected were always elders. Although senior people were as vigorous and healthy as the young, and sometimes wiser, the thinking was that they had at least already enjoyed a few decades of life. The wealthy might gain a brief reprieve by bribing the press gangs that came to fetch them; but, by constitutional law, nobody, not even the king himself, could put off their turn indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Spiritual men sought to comfort those who were afraid of being eaten by the dragon (which included almost everyone, although many denied it in public) by promising another life after death, a life that would be free from the dragon-scourge. Other orators argued that the dragon has its place in the natural order and a moral right to be fed. They said that it was part of the very meaning of being human to end up in the dragon’s stomach. Others still maintained that the dragon was good for the human species because it kept the population size down. To what extent these arguments convinced the worried souls is not known. Most people tried to cope by not thinking about the grim end that awaited them.</p>\n<p>For many centuries this desperate state of affairs continued. Nobody kept count any longer of the cumulative death toll, nor of the number of tears shed by the bereft. Expectations had gradually adjusted and the dragon-tyrant had become a fact of life. In view of the evident futility of resistance, attempts to kill the dragon had ceased. Instead, efforts now focused on placating it. While the dragon would occasionally raid the cities, it was found that the punctual delivery to the mountain of its quota of life reduced the frequency of these incursions.</p>\n<p>Knowing that their turn to become dragon-fodder was always impending, people began having children earlier and more often. It was not uncommon for a girl to be pregnant by her sixteenth birthday. Couples often spawned a dozen children. The human population was thus kept from shrinking, and the dragon was kept from going hungry.</p>\n<p>Over the course of these centuries, the dragon, being well fed, slowly but steadily grew bigger. It had become almost as large as the mountain on which it lived. And its appetite had increased proportionately. Ten thousand human bodies were no longer enough to fill its belly. It now demanded eighty thousand, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.</p>\n<p>What occupied the king’s mind more than the deaths and the dragon itself was the logistics of collecting and transporting so many people to the mountain every day. This was not an easy task.</p>\n<p>To facilitate the process, the king had a railway track constructed: two straight lines of glistening steel leading up to the dragon’s abode. Every twenty minutes, a train would arrive at the mountain terminal crammed with people, and would return empty. On moonlit nights, the passengers traveling on this train, if there had been windows for them to stick their heads out of, would have been able to see in front of them the double silhouette of the dragon and the mountain, and two glowing red eyes, like the beams from a pair of giant lighthouses, pointing the way to annihilation.</p>\n<p>Servants were employed by the king in large numbers to administer the tribute. There were registrars who kept track of whose turn it was to be sent. There were people-collectors who would be dispatched in special carts to fetch the designated people. Often traveling at breakneck speed, they would rush their cargo either to a railway station or directly to the mountain. There were clerks who administered the pensions paid to the decimated families who were no longer able to support themselves. There were comforters who would travel with the doomed on their way to the dragon, trying to ease their anguish with spirits and drugs.</p>\n<p>There was, moreover, a cadre of dragonologists who studied how these logistic processes could be made more efficient. Some dragonologists also conducted studies of the dragon’s physiology and behavior, and collected samples – its shed scales, the slime that drooled from its jaws, its lost teeth, and its excrements, which were specked with fragments of human bone. All these items were painstakingly annotated and archived. The more the beast was understood, the more the general perception of its invincibility was confirmed. Its black scales, in particular, were harder than any material known to man, and there seemed no way to make as much as a scratch in its armor.</p>\n<p>To finance all these activities, the king levied heavy taxes on his people. Dragon-related expenditures, already accounting for one seventh of the economy, were growing even faster than the dragon itself.</p>\n<p>Humanity is a curious species. Every once in a while, somebody gets a good idea. Others copy the idea, adding to it their own improvements. Over time, many wondrous tools and systems are developed. Some of these devices – calculators, thermometers, microscopes, and the glass vials that the chemists use to boil and distil liquids – serve to make it easier to generate and try out new ideas, including ideas that expedite the process of idea-generation.</p>\n<p>Thus the great wheel of invention, which had turned at an almost imperceptibly slow pace in the older ages, gradually began to accelerate.</p>\n<p>Sages predicted that a day would come when technology would enable humans to fly and do many other astonishing things. One of the sages, who was held in high esteem by some of the other sages but whose eccentric manners had made him a social outcast and recluse, went so far as to predict that technology would eventually make it possible to build a contraption that could kill the dragon-tyrant.</p>\n<p>The king’s scholars, however, dismissed these ideas. They said that humans were far too heavy to fly and in any case lacked feathers. And as for the impossible notion that the dragon-tyrant could be killed, history books recounted hundreds of attempts to do just that, not one of which had been successful. “We all know that this man had some irresponsible ideas,” a scholar of letters later wrote in his obituary of the reclusive sage who had by then been sent off to be devoured by the beast whose demise he had foretold, “but his writings were quite entertaining and perhaps we should be grateful to the dragon for making possible the interesting genre of dragon-bashing literature which reveals so much about the culture of angst!”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the wheel of invention kept turning. Mere decades later, humans did fly and accomplished many other astonishing things.</p>\n<p>A few iconoclastic dragonologists began arguing for a new attack on the dragon-tyrant. Killing the dragon would not be easy, they said, but if some material could be invented that was harder than the dragon’s armor, and if this material could be fashioned into some kind of projectile, then maybe the feat would be possible. At first, the iconoclasts’ ideas were rejected by their dragonologist peers on grounds that no known material was harder than dragon scales. But after working on the problem for many years, one of the iconoclasts succeeded in demonstrating that a dragon scale could be pierced by an object made of a certain composite material. Many dragonologists who had previously been skeptical now joined the iconoclasts. Engineers calculated that a huge projectile could be made of this material and launched with sufficient force to penetrate the dragon’s armor. However, the manufacture of the needed quantity of the composite material would be expensive.</p>\n<p>A group of several eminent engineers and dragonologists sent a petition to the king asking for funding to build the anti-dragon projectile. At time when the petition was sent, the king was preoccupied with leading his army into war against a tiger. The tiger had killed a farmer and subsequently disappeared into the jungle. There was widespread fear in the countryside that the tiger might come out and strike again. The king had the jungle surrounded and ordered his troops to begin slashing their way through it. At the conclusion of the campaign, the king could announce that all 163 tigers in the jungle, including presumably the murderous one, had been hunted down and killed. During the tumult of the war, however, the petition had been lost or forgotten.</p>\n<p>The petitioners therefore sent another appeal. This time they received a reply from one of the king’s secretaries saying that the king would consider their request after he was done reviewing the annual dragon-administration budget. This year’s budget was the largest to date and included funding for a new railway track to the mountain. A second track was deemed necessary, as the original track could no longer support the increasing traffic. (The tribute demanded by the dragon-tyrant had increased to one hundred thousand human beings, to be delivered to the foot of the mountain every evening at the onset of dark.) When the budget was finally approved, however, reports were coming from a remote part of the country that a village was suffering from a rattlesnake infestation. The king had to leave urgently to mobilize his army and ride off to defeat this new threat. The anti-dragonists’ appeal was filed away in a dusty cabinet in the castle basement.</p>\n<p>The anti-dragonists met again to decide what was to be done. The debate was animated and continued long into the night. It was almost daybreak when they finally resolved to take the matter to the people. Over the following weeks, they traveled around the country, gave public lectures, and explained their proposal to anyone who would listen. At first, people were skeptical. They had been taught in school that the dragon-tyrant was invincible and that the sacrifices it demanded had to be accepted as a fact of life. Yet when they learnt about the new composite material and about the designs for the projectile, many became intrigued. In increasing numbers, citizens flocked to the anti-dragonist lectures. Activists started organizing public rallies in support of the proposal.</p>\n<p>When the king read about these meetings in the newspaper, he summoned his advisors and asked them what they thought about it. They informed him about the petitions that had been sent but told him that the anti-dragonists were troublemakers whose teachings were causing public unrest. It was much better for the social order, they said, that the people accepted the inevitability of the dragon-tyrant tribute. The dragon-administration provided many jobs that would be lost if the dragon was slaughtered. There was no known social good coming from the conquest of the dragon. In any case, the king’s coffers were currently nearly empty after the two military campaigns and the funding set aside for the second railway line. The king, who was at the time enjoying great popularity for having vanquished the rattlesnake infestation, listened to his advisors’ arguments but worried that he might lose some of his popular support if was seen to ignore the anti-dragonist petition. He therefore decided to hold an open hearing. Leading dragonologists, ministers of the state, and interested members of the public were invited to attend.</p>\n<p>The meeting took place on the darkest day of the year, just before the Christmas holidays, in the largest hall of the royal castle. The hall was packed to the last seat and people were crowding in the aisles. The mood was charged with an earnest intensity normally reserved for pivotal wartime sessions.</p>\n<p>After the king had welcomed everyone, he gave the floor to the leading scientist behind the anti-dragonist proposal, a woman with a serious, almost stern expression on her face. She proceeded to explain in clear language how the proposed device would work and how the requisite amount of the composite material could be manufactured. Given the requested amount of funding, it should be possible to complete the work in fifteen to twenty years. With an even greater amount of funding, it might be possible to do it in as little as twelve years. However, there could be no absolute guarantee that it would work. The crowd followed her presentation intently.</p>\n<p>Next to speak was the king’s chief advisor for morality, a man with a booming voice that easily filled the auditorium:</p>\n<p>“Let us grant that this woman is correct about the science and that the project is technologically possible, although I don’t think that has actually been proven. Now she desires that we get rid of the dragon. Presumably, she thinks she’s got the right not to be chewed up by the dragon. How willful and presumptuous. The finitude of human life is a blessing for every individual, whether he knows it or not. Getting rid of the dragon, which might seem like such a convenient thing to do, would undermine our human dignity. The preoccupation with killing the dragon will deflect us from realizing more fully the aspirations to which our lives naturally point, from living well rather than merely staying alive. It is debasing, yes debasing, for a person to want to continue his or her mediocre life for as long as possible without worrying about some of the higher questions about what life is to be used for. But I tell you, the nature of the dragon is to eat humans, and our own species-specified nature is truly and nobly fulfilled only by getting eaten by it...”</p>\n<p>The audience listened respectfully to this highly decorated speaker. The phrases were so eloquent that it was hard to resist the feeling that some deep thoughts must lurk behind them, although nobody could quite grasp what they were. Surely, words coming from such a distinguished appointee of the king must have profound substance.</p>\n<p>The speaker next in line was a spiritual sage who was widely respected for his kindness and gentleness as well as for his devotion. As he strode to the podium, a small boy yelled out from the audience: “The dragon is bad!”</p>\n<p>The boy’s parents turned bright red and began hushing and scolding the child. But the sage said, “Let the boy speak. He is probably wiser than an old fool like me.”</p>\n<p>At first, the boy was too scared and confused to move. But when he saw the genuinely friendly smile on the sage’s face and the outreached hand, he obediently took it and followed the sage up to the podium. “Now, there’s a brave little man,” said the sage. “Are you afraid of the dragon?“</p>\n<p>“I want my granny back,” said the boy.</p>\n<p>“Did the dragon take your granny away?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” the boy said, tears welling up in his large frightened eyes. “Granny promised that she would teach me how to bake gingerbread cookies for Christmas. She said that we would make a little house out of gingerbread and little gingerbread men that would live in it. Then those people in white clothes came and took Granny away to the dragon… The dragon is bad and it eats people… I want my Granny back!”</p>\n<p>At this point the child was crying so hard that the sage had to return him to his parents.</p>\n<p>There were several other speakers that evening, but the child’s simple testimony had punctured the rhetorical balloon that the king’s ministers had tried to inflate. The people were backing the anti-dragonists, and by the end of the evening even the king had come to recognize the reason and the humanity of their cause. In his closing statement, he simply said: “Let’s do it!”</p>\n<p>As the news spread, celebrations erupted in the streets. Those who had been campaigning for the anti-dragonists toasted each other and drank to the future of humanity.</p>\n<p>The next morning, a billion people woke up and realized that their turn to be sent to the dragon would come before the projectile would be completed. A tipping point was reached. Whereas before, active support for the anti-dragonist cause had been limited to a small group of visionaries, it now became the number one priority and concern on everybody’s mind. The abstract notion of “the general will” took on an almost tangible intensity and concreteness. Mass rallies raised money for the projectile project and urged the king to increase the level of state support. The king responded to these appeals. In his New Year address, he announced that he would pass an extra appropriations bill to support the project at a high level of funding; additionally, he would sell off his summer castle and some of his land and make a large personal donation. “I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of freeing the world from the ancient scourge of the dragon-tyrant.”</p>\n<p>Thus started a great technological race against time. The concept of an anti-dragon projectile was simple, but to make it a reality required solutions to a thousand smaller technical problems, each of which required dozens of time-consuming steps and missteps. Test-missiles were fired but fell dead to the ground or flew off in the wrong direction. In one tragic accident, a wayward missile landed on a hospital and killed several hundred patients and staff. But there was now a real seriousness of purpose, and the tests continued even as the corpses were being dug out from the debris.</p>\n<p>Despite almost unlimited funding and round-the-clock work by the technicians, the king’s deadline could not be met. The decade concluded and the dragon was still alive and well. But the effort was getting closer. A prototype missile had been successfully test fired. Production of the core, made of the expensive composite material, was on schedule for its completion to coincide with the finishing of the fully tested and debugged missile shell into which it was to be loaded. The launch date was set to the following year’s New Year’s Eve, exactly twelve years after the project’s official inauguration. The best-selling Christmas gift that year was a calendar that counted down the days to time zero, the proceeds going to the projectile project.</p>\n<p>The king had undergone a personal transformation from his earlier frivolous and thoughtless self. He now spent as much time as he could in the laboratories and the manufacturing plants, encouraging the workers and praising their toil. Sometimes he would bring a sleeping bag and spend the night on a noisy machine floor. He even studied and tried to understand the technical aspects of their work. Yet he confined himself to giving moral support and refrained from meddling in technical and managerial matters.</p>\n<p>Seven days before New Year, the woman who had made the case for the project almost twelve years earlier, and was now its chief executive, came to the royal castle and requested an urgent audience with the king. When the king got her note, he excused himself to the foreign dignitaries whom he was reluctantly entertaining at the annual Christmas dinner and hurried off to the private room where the scientist was waiting. As always of late, she looked pale and worn from her long working hours. This evening, however, the king also thought he could detect a ray of relief and satisfaction in her eyes.</p>\n<p>She told him that the missile had been deployed, the core had been loaded, everything had been triple-checked, they were ready to launch, and would the king give his final go-ahead. The king sank down in an armchair and closed his eyes. He was thinking hard. By launching the projectile tonight, one week early, seven hundred thousand people would be saved. Yet if something went wrong, if it missed its target and hit the mountain instead, it would be a disaster. A new core would have to be constructed from scratch and the project would be set back by some four years. He sat there, silently, for almost an hour. Just as the scientist had become convinced that he had fallen asleep, he opened his eyes and said in a firm voice: “No. I want you to go right back to the lab. I want you to check and then re-check everything again.” The scientist could not help a sigh escaping her; but she nodded and left.</p>\n<p>The last day of the year was cold and overcast, but there was no wind, which meant good launch conditions. The sun was setting. Technicians were scuttling around making the final adjustments and giving everything one last check. The king and his closest advisors were observing from a platform close to the launch pad. Further away, behind a fence, large numbers of the public had assembled to witness the great event. A large clock was showing the countdown: fifty minutes to go.</p>\n<p>An advisor tapped the king on the shoulder and drew his attention to the fence. There was some tumult. Somebody had apparently jumped the fence and was running towards the platform where the king sat. Security quickly caught up with him. He was handcuffed and taken away. The king turned his attention back to the launch pad, and to the mountain in the background. In front of it, he could see the dark slumped profile of the dragon. It was eating.</p>\n<p>Some twenty minutes later, the king was surprised to see the handcuffed man reappearing a short distance from the platform. His nose was bleeding and he was accompanied by two security guards. The man appeared to be in a frenzied state. When he spotted the king, he began shouting at the top of his lungs: “The last train! The last train! Stop the last train!”</p>\n<p>“Who is this young man?” said the king. “His face seems familiar, but I cannot quite place him. What does he want? Let him come up.”</p>\n<p>The young man was a junior clerk in the ministry of transportation, and the reason for his frenzy was that he had discovered that his father was on the last train to the mountain. The king had ordered the train traffic to continue, fearing that any disruption might cause the dragon to stir and leave the open field in front of the mountain where it now spent most of its time. The young man begged the king to issue a recall-order for the last train, which was due to arrive at the mountain terminal five minutes before time zero.</p>\n<p>“I cannot do it,” said the king, “I cannot take the risk.”</p>\n<p>“But the trains frequently run five minutes late. The dragon won’t notice! Please!”</p>\n<p>The young man was kneeling before the king, imploring him to save his father’s life and the lives of the other thousand passengers onboard that last train.</p>\n<p>The king looked down at the pleading, bloodied face of the young man. But he bit his lip, and shook his head. The young man continued to wail even as the guards carried him off the platform: “Please! Stop the last train! Please!”</p>\n<p>The king stood silent and motionless, until, after while, the wailing suddenly ceased. The king looked up and glanced over at the countdown clock: five minutes remaining.</p>\n<p>Four minutes. Three minutes. Two minutes.</p>\n<p>The last technician left the launch pad.</p>\n<p>30 seconds. 20 seconds. Ten, nine, eight…</p>\n<p>As a ball of fire enveloped the launch pad and the missile shot out, the spectators instinctively rose to the tips of their toes, and all eyes fixated at the front end of the white flame from the rocket’s afterburners heading towards the distant mountain. The masses, the king, the low and the high, the young and the old, it was as if at this moment they shared a single awareness, a single conscious experience: that white flame, shooting into the dark, embodying the human spirit, its fear and its hope… striking at the heart of evil. The silhouette on the horizon tumbled, and fell. Thousand voices of pure joy rose from the assembled masses, joined seconds later by a deafening drawn-out thud from the collapsing monster as if the Earth itself was drawing a sigh of relief. After centuries of oppression, humanity at last was free from the cruel tyranny of the dragon.</p>\n<p>The joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant: “Long live the king! Long live us all!” The king’s advisors, like everybody that night, were as happy as children; they embraced each other and congratulated the king: “We did it! We did it!”</p>\n<p>But the king answered in a broken voice: “Yes, we did it, we killed the dragon today. But damn, why did we start so late? This could have been done five, maybe ten years ago! Millions of people wouldn’t have had to die.”</p>\n<p>The king stepped off the platform and walked up to the young man in handcuffs, who was sitting on the ground. There he fell down on his knees. “Forgive me! Oh my God, please forgive me!”</p>\n<p>The rain started falling, in large, heavy drops, turning the ground into mud, drenching the king’s purple robes, and dissolving the blood on the young man’s face. “I am so very sorry about your father,” said the king.</p>\n<p>“It’s not your fault,” replied the young man. “Do you remember twelve years ago in the castle? That crying little boy who wanted you to bring back his grandmother – that was me. I didn’t realize then that you couldn’t possibly do what I asked for. Today I wanted you to save my father. Yet it was impossible to do that now, without jeopardizing the launch. But you have saved my life, and my mother and my sister. How can we ever thank you enough for that?”</p>\n<p>“Listen to them,” said the king, gesturing towards the crowds. “They are cheering me for what happened tonight. But the hero is you. You cried out. You rallied us against evil.” The king signaled a guard to come and unlock the handcuffs. “Now, go to your mother and sister. You and your family shall always be welcome at the court, and anything you wish for – if it be within my power – shall be granted.”</p>\n<p>The young man left, and the royal entourage, huddling in the downpour, accumulated around their monarch who was still kneeling in the mud. Amongst the fancy couture, which was being increasingly ruined by the rain, a bunch of powdered faces expressed a superposition of joy, relief, and discombobulation. So much had changed in the last hour: the right to an open future had been regained, a primordial fear had been abolished, and many a long-held assumption had been overturned. Unsure now about what was required of them in this unfamiliar situation, they stood there tentatively, as if probing whether the ground would still hold, exchanging glances, and waiting for some kind of indication.</p>\n<p>Finally, the king rose, wiping his hands on the sides of his pants.</p>\n<p>“Your majesty, what do we do now?” ventured the most senior courtier.</p>\n<p>“My dear friends,” said the king, “we have come a long way… yet our journey has only just begun. Our species is young on this planet. Today we are like children again. The future lies open before us. We shall go into this future and try to do better than we have done in the past. We have time now – time to get things right, time to grow up, time to learn from our mistakes, time for the slow process of building a better world, and time to get settled in it. Tonight, let all the bells in the kingdom ring until midnight, in remembrance of our dead forbears, and then after midnight let us celebrate till the sun comes up. And in the coming days… I believe we have some reorganization to do!”</p>\n<h2>Moral</h2>\n<p>Stories about aging have traditionally focused on the need for graceful accommodation. The recommended solution to diminishing vigor and impending death was resignation coupled with an effort to achieve closure in practical affairs and personal relationships. Given that nothing could be done to prevent or retard aging, this focus made sense. Rather than fretting about the inevitable, one could aim for peace of mind.</p>\n<p>Today we face a different situation. While we still lack effective and acceptable means for slowing the aging process<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-1\" id=\"fnref-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-1\">[1]</a></sup>, we can identify research directions that might lead to the development of such means in the foreseeable future. “Deathist” stories and ideologies, which counsel passive acceptance, are no longer harmless sources of consolation. They are fatal barriers to urgently needed action.</p>\n<p>Many distinguished technologists and scientists tell us that it will become possible to retard, and eventually to halt and reverse, human senescence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-2\" id=\"fnref-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-2\">[2]</a></sup> At present, there is little agreement about the time-scale or the specific means, nor is there a consensus that the goal is even achievable in principle. In relation to the fable (where aging is, of course, represented by the dragon), we are therefore at a stage somewhere between that at which the lone sage predicted the dragon’s eventual demise and that at which the iconoclast dragonologists convinced their peers by demonstrating a composite material that was harder than dragon scales.</p>\n<p>The ethical argument that the fable presents is simple: There are obvious and compelling moral reasons for the people in the fable to get rid of the dragon. Our situation with regard to human senescence is closely analogous and ethically isomorphic to the situation of the people in the fable with regard to the dragon. Therefore, we have compelling moral reasons to get rid of human senescence.</p>\n<p>The argument is not in favor or life-span extension <em>per se</em>. Adding extra years of sickness and debility at the end of life would be pointless. The argument is in favor of extending, as far as possible, the human <em>health-span</em>. By slowing or halting the aging process, the healthy human life span would be extended. Individuals would be able to remain healthy, vigorous, and productive at ages at which they would otherwise be dead.</p>\n<p>In addition to this general moral, there are a number of more specific lessons:</p>\n<p><em>(1)</em>  <em>A recurrent tragedy became a fact of life, a statistic</em>. In the fable, people’s expectations adapted to the existence of the dragon, to the extent that many became unable to perceive its badness. Aging, too, has become a mere “fact of life” – despite being the principal cause of an unfathomable amount of human suffering and death.</p>\n<p><em>(2)</em>  <em>A static view of technology</em>. People reasoned that it would never become possible to kill the dragon because all attempts had failed in the past. They failed to take into account accelerated technological progress. Is a similar mistake leading us to underestimate the chances of a cure for aging?</p>\n<p><em>(3)</em>  <em>Administration became its own purpose</em>. One seventh of the economy went to dragon-administration (which is also the fraction of its GDP that the U.S. spends on healthcare). Damage-limitation became such an exclusive focus that it made people neglect the underlying cause. Instead of a massive publicly-funded research program to halt aging, we spend almost our entire health budget on health-care and on researching individual diseases.</p>\n<p><em>(4)</em>  <em>The social good became detached from the good for people</em>. The king’s advisors worried about the possible social problems that could be caused by the anti-dragonists. They said that no known social good would come from the demise of the dragon. Ultimately, however, social orders exist for the benefit of people, and it is generally good for people if their lives are saved.</p>\n<p><em>(5)</em>  <em>The lack of a sense of proportion.</em> A tiger killed a farmer. A rhumba of rattlesnakes plagued a village. The king got rid of the tiger and the rattlesnakes, and thereby did his people a service. Yet he was at fault, because he got his priorities wrong.</p>\n<p><em>(6)</em>  <em>Fine phrases and hollow rhetoric</em>. The king’s morality advisor spoke eloquently about human dignity and our species-specified nature, in phrases lifted, mostly verbatim, from the advisor’s contemporary equivalents.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-3\" id=\"fnref-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-3\">[3]</a></sup> Yet the rhetoric was a smoke screen that hid rather than revealed moral reality. The boy’s inarticulate but honest testimony, by contrast, points to the central fact of the case: the dragon is bad; it destroys people. This is also the basic truth about human senescence.</p>\n<p><em>(7)</em>  <em>Failure to appreciate the urgency.</em> Until very late in the story, nobody fully realized what was at stake. Only as the king was staring into the bloodied face of the young pleading man does the extent of the tragedy sink in. Searching for a cure for aging is not just a nice thing that we should perhaps one day get around to. It is an urgent, screaming moral imperative. The sooner we start a focused research program, the sooner we will get results. It matters if we get the cure in 25 years rather than in 24 years: a population greater than that of Canada would die as a result. In this matter, time equals life, at a rate of approximately 70 lives per minute. With the meter ticking at such a furious rate, we should stop faffing about.</p>\n<p><em>(8)</em>  <em>“And in the coming days… I believe we have some reorganization to do!”</em> The king and his people will face some major challenges when they recover from their celebration. Their society has been so conditioned and deformed by the presence of the dragon that a frightening void now exists. They will have to work creatively, on both an individual and a societal level, to develop conditions that will keep lives flourishingly dynamic and meaningful beyond the accustomed three-score-years-and-ten. Luckily, the human spirit is good at adapting. Another issue that they may eventually confront is overpopulation. Maybe people will have to learn to have children later and less frequently. Maybe they can find ways to sustain a larger population by using more efficient technology. Maybe they will one day develop spaceships and begin to colonize the cosmos. We can leave, for now, the long-lived fable people to grapple with these new challenges, while we try to make some progress in our own adventure.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-4\" id=\"fnref-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-DZooNPWDeE2c3BTdL-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Calorie restriction (a diet low in calories but high in nutrients) extends maximal lifespan and delays the onset of age-related illnesses in all species that have been tested.

This hypothesis is known as “valuation by prototype.”</p>\n<p>An alternative hypothesis is “purchase of moral satisfaction.” People spend enough money to create a <em>warm glow</em> in themselves, a sense of having done their duty.

The full significance of this third way is commonly overlooked.&nbsp;</p><p>It is, of course, widely appreciated that certain academic contributions lay the theoretical or empirical foundations for further work.&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason why a great scientist such as Einstein is celebrated is that his discoveries have enabled thousands of other scientists to tackle problems that they could not have solved without relativity theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet even this deep and beautiful theory is, in one sense, very narrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;While relativity is of great help in cosmology and some other parts of physics, it is of little use to a geneticist, a paleontologist, or a neuroscientist.&nbsp;&nbsp;General relativity theory is therefore a significant but not a vast contribution to the scientific enterprise as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Some findings have wider applicability.&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific method itself — the idea of creating hypotheses and subjecting them to stringent empirical tests — is one such.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the basic results in statistics also have very wide applicability.&nbsp;&nbsp;And some scientific instruments, such as the thermometer, the microscope, and the computer, have proved enormously useful over a wide range of domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutional innovations — such as the peer‐reviewed journal — should also be counted.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who seek the advancement of human knowledge should focus more on these kinds of indirect contribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;A “superficial” contribution that facilitates work across a wide range of domains can be worth much more than a relatively “profound” contribution limited to one narrow field, just as a lake can contain a lot more water than a well, even if the well is deeper.&nbsp;</p><p>No contribution would be more generally applicable than one that improves the performance of the human brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much more effort ought to be devoted to the development of techniques for cognitive enhancement, be they drugs to improve concentration, mental energy, and memory, or nutritional enrichments of infant formula to optimize brain development.&nbsp;&nbsp;Society invests vast resources in education in an attempt to improve students’ cognitive abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does it spend so little on studying the biology of maximizing the performance of the human nervous system?&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine a researcher invented an inexpensive drug which was completely safe and which improved all‐round cognitive performance by just 1%.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gain would hardly be noticeable in a single individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the 10 million scientists in the world all benefited from the drug the inventor would increase the rate of scientific progress by roughly the same amount as adding 100,000 new scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year the invention would amount to an indirect contribution equal to 100,000 times what the average scientist contributes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even an Einstein or a Darwin at the peak of their powers could not make such a great impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile others too could benefit from being able to think better, including engineers, school children, accountants, and politicians.&nbsp;</p><p>This example illustrates the enormous potential of improving human cognition by even a tiny amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are serious about seeking the advancement of human knowledge and understanding need to crunch the numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Better academic institutions, methodologies, instrumentation, and especially cognitive enhancement are the fast tracks to scientific progress.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"tHSMZ8brCzhLu4HY8":2,"W47HrrhkZsDZo9yGd":2,"uDAGFwZLscHKfoubc":2},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000047,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-19T06:37:19.632Z","name":"Scientific progress","slug":"scientific-progress","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>scientific progress</strong> tag is for posts about:</p><ul><li>The potential risks and benefits of progress in different areas</li><li>Strategies for changing the rate of progress in different areas</li><li>General information related to progress (e.g. factors that tend to encourage it)</li><li>Specific examples of progress (e.g. a major advance in an important scientific field)</li></ul><p>For posts about more specific aspects of the scientific ecosystem and how that can be improved, use the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/meta-science\">meta-science</a> tag.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/academia-1/\">academia</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/differential-progress\">differential progress</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/meta-science\">meta-science</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/economic-growth\">economic growth</a> | &nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/research-methods\">research methods</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/speeding-up-development\">speeding up development</a></p>","postCount":66,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"tHSMZ8brCzhLu4HY8"},{"createdAt":"2020-10-03T08:06:11.249Z","name":"Meta-science","slug":"meta-science","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>meta-science</strong> tag is used for posts discussing how science is being done and what can be done to improve on it.

The chapter was written by Ali Nouri and Christopher F. Chyba.</p><p>We've made a few small formatting changes to make the text easier to follow.</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Biotechnological power is increasing exponentially, reminiscent of the increase in computing power since the invention of electronic computers. The co-founder of Intel Corporation, Gordon Moore, pointed out in 1965 that the number of transistors per computer chip - a measure of how much computation can be done in a given volume - has doubled roughly every 18 months (Moore, 1965). This exponential increase in computing power, now called 'Moore's Law', has continued to hold in the decades since then (Lundstrom, 2003) and is the reason that individuals now have more computing power available in their personal computers than that was available only to the most advanced nations only decades ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Although biotechnology's exponential lift off began decades after that of computing, its rate of increase, as measured, for example, by the time needed to synthesize a given DNA sequence, is as fast or faster than that of Moore's Law (Carlson, 2003). Just as Moore's Law led to a world of personal computing and home appliance microprocessors, so biotechnological innovation is moving us into a world where the synthesis of DNA, as well as other biological manipulations, will be increasingly available to small groups of technically competent and even individual users.</p><p>There is already a list of well-known experiments - and many others that have received less public attention - that illustrates the potential dangers intrinsic to modern biological research and development. We review several examples of these in some detail below, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Genetic manipulations that have rendered certain viruses far more deadly to their animal hosts (Jackson et al., 2001).</li><li>The synthesis of polio virus from readily purchased chemical supplies (Cello et al., 2002) - so that even if the World Health Organization (WHO) succeeds in its important task for eradicating polio worldwide, the virus can be reconstituted in laboratories around the world.</li><li>The reduction in the time needed to synthesize a virus genome comparable in size to the polio virus from years to weeks.</li><li>The laboratory re-synthesis of the 1918 human influenza virus that killed tens of millions of people worldwide (Tumpey et al., 2005).</li><li>The discovery of 'RNA interference', which allows researchers to turn off certain genes in humans or other organisms (Sen et al., 2006).</li><li>And the new field of 'synthetic biology', whose goal is to allow practitioners<br>to fabricate small 'biological devices' and ultimately new types of microbes<br>(Fu, 2006).</li></ul><p>The increase in biological power illustrated by these experiments, and the global spread of their underlying technologies, is predicted to lead to breathtaking advances in medicine, food security, and other areas crucial to human health and economic development. For example, the manipulation of biological systems is a powerful tool that allows controlled analysis of the function - and therefore vulnerabilities of and potential defences against - disease organisms. However, this power also brings with it the potential for misuse (NRC, 2006). It remains unclear how civilization can ensure that it reaps the benefits of biotechnology while protecting itself from the worst misuse.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the rapid spread of technology, this problem is an intrinsically international one. However, there are currently no good models from Cold War arms control or non-proliferation diplomacy that are suited to regulating this uniquely powerful and accessible technology (Chyba and Greninger, 2004). There are at least two severe challenges to any regulatory scheme (Chyba, 2006). The first is the mismatch between the rapid pace of biotechnological advances and the comparative sluggishness of multilateral negotiation and regime building. The second is the questionable utility of large-scale monitoring and inspections strategies to an increasingly widespread, small-scale technology.</p><p>However, this is not a counsel for despair. What is needed is a comprehensive strategy for the pursuit of biological security - which we assume here to be the protection of people, animals, agriculture and the environment against natural or intentional outbreaks of disease. Such a strategy is not yet in place, either nationally or globally, but its contours are clear. Importantly, this strategy must be attentive to different categories of risk, and pay attention to how responses within one category strengthen or weaken the response to another. These categories of risk include: naturally occurring diseases; illicit state biological weapons programmes; non-state actors and bio-hackers; and laboratory accidents or other inadvertent release of disease agents.</p><p>Just this listing alone emphasizes several important facts. The first is that while about 14 million people die annually from infectious diseases (WHO, 2004) (mostly in the developing world), only five people died in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States (Jernigan et al., 2002), and there have been very few other modern acts of biological terrorism. Any approach to the dual-use challenge of biotechnology, which substantially curtails the utility of biotechnology to treat and counter disease, runs the risk of sacrificing large numbers of lives to head off hypothetical risks.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet it is already clear that humans can manipulate pathogens in ways that go beyond what evolution has so far wrought, so the hypothetical must nevertheless be taken seriously. A proper balance is needed, and an African meeting on these issues in October 2005 suggested one way to strike it. The Kampala Compact declared that while 'the potential devastation caused by biological weapons would be catastrophic for Africa' , it is 'illegitimate' to address biological weapons threats without also addressing key public health issues such as infectious disease. The developed and developing world must find common ground.</p><p>A second important observation regarding biological terrorism is that there have, so far, been very few actual attacks by non-state groups. It is clearly important to understand why this has been the case, and to probe the extent to which it has been due to capabilities or motivations - and how whatever inhibitions may have been acting can be strengthened. Sceptical treatments of the biological terrorism threat, and of the dangers of apocalyptic dramatization more generally, can place important focus on these issues - though the examples of dual-use research already mentioned, plus recent US National Academy of Sciences studies and statements by the UN Secretary-General make it clear that the problem is real, not hype.&nbsp;</p><p>(One important sceptical discussion of the bioterrorism threat is Milton Leitenberg, <a href=\"https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M-Leitenbergs-full-Army-War-College-Book.pdf\"><i>Assessing the Biological Weapons and Bioterrorism Threat</i></a>.)</p><p>While the focus of this chapter will be on biotechnological capabilities, and how those capabilities may be responsibly controlled, it should be remembered that a capabilities-based threat assessment only provides part of the comprehensive picture that is required. Indeed, it is striking to compare the focus on capabilities in many technology oriented threat assessments with the tenor of one of the most influential threat assessments in US history, George Kennan's 'X' article in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> in 1947. In this piece, Kennan crystallized the US policy of containment of the Soviet Union that prevailed for decades of the Cold War. On reading today, one is struck by how little of the X article addressed Soviet capabilities. Rather, nearly all of it concerned Soviet intentions and motives, with information based on Kennan's experience in Soviet society, his fluency in Russian, and his knowledge of Russian history and culture. To the extent that the biological security threat emanates from terrorist groups or irresponsible nations, a similar sophistication with respect to motives and behaviour must be brought to bear (see also Chapters 4 and 19 in this volume).</p><p>In this chapter, we first provide a survey of biological weapons in history and efforts to control their use by states via multilateral treaties.

I know this sounds controversial, but hear me out.</p>\n<p>According to Population Services International, a respected charity research group, it costs <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://www.givewell.net/PSI\">between $650 and $1000</a> to save one child's life through charity. You've probably heard lower numbers like twenty cents somewhere. The lower numbers are wrong. Yes, maybe an anti-measles vaccine for a kid in Africa only costs twenty cents, and measles can be fatal. But there's a lot of overhead, and you have to immunize a lot of people before you get the one kid otherwise destined to die of measles. I find the $650-$1000 figure much more believable. Let's round it off to $800.</p>\n<p>So one dead child = eight hundred dollars. If you spend eight hundred dollars on a laptop, that's one African kid who died because you didn't give it to charity. Distasteful but true. Now that we know that, we can get down to the details of designing the currency itself. It should be a big gold coin, with a picture of a smiling Burmese child on the front, and a tombstone on the back. The abbreviation can be DC.</p>\n<p>Of course, most things won't cost a whole dead child, so we'll need smaller denominations. There are four dead puppies to the dead child, since <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://www.helpsaveastray.com/support-your-shelter.html\">dogs cost a bit above $200 to keep alive in an animal shelter</a>. There are two <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://www.staro.org/index.php?id=faq039s\">burnt rainforests</a> per puppy, and five <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://kenyaredcross.org/aboutdetail.php?subcat=27&amp;sublev=43\">infected wounds</a> per burnt rainforest. I'm sure we can find talented artists to design the coins for all of these.</p>\n<p>Yes, you grudgingly admit, such a system is technically feasible, but why in blue blazes would we want to replace our reassuring green dollar bills graced with dignified ex-presidents, with that?</p>\n<p>I leave that question to an article I read on the BBC site today: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/gloucestershire/7750192.stm\">woman spends £250,000 on a luxury doghouse for her Great Danes complete with spa and plasma TV</a>.</p>\n<p>This does sound sort of ridiculous, but clearly it is not ridiculous enough. After all, at least one person thought it would be a good idea. Clearly, saying \"doghouse that costs 250,000 pounds\" does not carry the appropriate punch of \"do not buy this.\"</p>\n<p>And that's why I recommend switching to a dead-child-based currency. \"Doghouse that costs 250,000 pounds\" might not carry the proper punch. \"Doghouse that costs 500 dead children\" does. Using dead children as a unit of currency carries a built-in awareness of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/positive-vs-opt.html\">opportunity</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_costs\">costs</a>. Yes, you can buy that doghouse, if you <em>really</em> think it's more important than spending that same money to save five hundred Haitian kids' lives. Go on! Dogs watching plasma TV! That sounds <em>adorable</em>!</p>\n<p>After reading an article about <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon403.htm\">Mormon tithing practices</a>, I am hopeful that the switch from dollars to DCs will destroy organized religion as well. It sounds plausible for a church to say it needs two million dollars to move to a larger building. It even sounds plausible when a pastor gets up there in front of his congregation and says that God really wants every family to just give whatever little bit they're able, so that they can all buy a better house of worship and praise God in a more fitting sanctuary. My old synagogue did this for years, and no one found anything wrong with it; my parents even donated quite a big chunk of money. If my rabbi'd had to say \"We need twenty-five hundred dead children to move to a sweeter pad\", the gig would have been up.</p>\n<p>Not like I am any saint myself. The past two years, I've spent about two dead puppies on books from <a href=\"http://Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> alone. I am probably going to spend very close to a whole dead child to fly home for my two week winter break, and I spent ten dead children on my trip around the world this summer. I spent four infected wounds on <em>fantasy map-making software</em>. But at least in the back of my mind I realize I'm doing it. Can the people who spend a dead kid plus a dead puppy on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/14/worlds-most-expensiv.html\">the world's most expensive sundae</a> say the same? What about <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://www.luxist.com/2007/01/03/diamond-studded-mobile-phone-strap/\">the Japanese guy spending 1050 dead kids on a mobile phone strap?</a></p>\n<p>One of America's top pro-life groups, Focus on the Family, spends <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114328/http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctliveblog/archives/2008/11/focus_on_the_fa.html\">two hundred thousand dead children a year</a> pushing its message of conservatism and opposition to abortion. Take a second to fully appreciate the irony there.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying these people don't have a right to spend their presumably hard-earned money on whatever they want. Of course they have that right. I am just saying that if we took the simple common sense step of changing our monetary denomination from dollars to dead children, maybe they'd want something different.</p>\n<p>C'mon, I bet you an infected wound it'd work great.</p>\n","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"eWH3tWCBbTnABLpxq":1,"ns9DfYvtox2pxEFxD":1},"voteCount":7,"baseScore":15,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000083,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2021-12-01T07:46:04.495Z","name":"Review crosspost","slug":"review-crosspost","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>Use the <strong>review crosspost </strong>tag for posts that you cross-posted in order to make them eligible for the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jB7Ten8qmDszRMTho/effective-altruism-the-first-decade-forum-review\">Decade Review</a>.</p>","postCount":22,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"eWH3tWCBbTnABLpxq"},{"createdAt":"2021-01-24T14:16:48.160Z","name":"Scott Alexander","slug":"scott-alexander","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Scott Alexander</strong> (born 1984) is a pseudonymous American psychiatrist and blogger.

I knew I had forgotten something.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> No wallet for you then. Have a nice evening.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Wait!</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> Sigh.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> I’ve got a business proposition for you.. . .How about you give me your wallet now? In return, I promise to come to your house tomorrow and give you double the value of what’s in the wallet. Not bad, eh? A 200% return on investment in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> No way.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Ah, you don’t believe that I will be as good as my word? One can’t be too careful these days. . . . Tell you what: give me your wallet, and I come to your house tomorrow and pay you 10 times its value.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> Sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> OK, let me ask you something. Many people are dishonest, but some people are honest. What probability do you give to the hypothesis that I will keep my promise?</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> 1 in 1,000?</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Great! OK, so give me your wallet, and tomorrow I give you 2,000 times the value of its contents. The expectation value is greatly to your advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> There are 10 livres in my wallet. If we made a deal for you to take the wallet and bring me 10 times the value of its contents tomorrow, then maybe there’s a 1-in-a-1,000 chance that I would see the 100 livres you owe. But I’d rate the chances that you will deliver on a deal to return me 20,000 livres much lower. I doubt you even have that much money.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Your scepticism is understandable, although in this particular case it happens to be misguided. For you are M. Pascal if I’m altogether not mis-taken? And I’ve heard that you’re a committed expected-Utility maximizer, and that your Utility function is aggregative in terms of happy days of life. Is that not so?</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> It is. My Utility function is unbounded. And I deem two days of happy life twice as good as one such day; and 2,000 days twice as good as 1,000 days. I don’t believe in risk aversion or temporal discounting.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Excellent. I don’t necessarily have to know that you reject risk aversion and temporal discounting, but it makes things easier. Well, have I got good news for you! I have magical powers. I can give you any finite amount of money that you might ask for tonight. What’s more, I can give you any finite amount of Utility that I choose to promise you tonight.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> And I should believe you why?</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Trust me! OK, I realize this does not give you conclusive evidence, but surely it counts a least a little bit in favour of the truth of what I am asserting. Honestly, I really do have these powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> Your conduct tonight has not inspired me with confidence in your honesty.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> OK, OK, OK, OK. But isn’t it possible that I am telling the truth?</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> It is possible that you have the magic powers that you claim to have, but let me tell you, I give that a very, very low probability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> That’s fine. But tell me, how low a probability exactly? Remember, you might think it all seems implausible, but we are all fallible, right? And you must admit, from what you’ve already seen and heard, that I am a rather atypical mugger. And look at my pale countenance, my dark eyes; and note that I’m dressed in black from top to toe. These are some of the telltale signs of an Operator of the Seventh Dimension. That’s where I come from and that’s where the magic work gets done.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> Gee. . .OK, don’t take this personally, but my credence that you have these magic powers whereof you speak is about one in a quadrillion.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Wow, you are pretty confident in your own ability to tell a liar from an honest man! But no matter. Let me also ask you, what’s your probability that I not only have magic powers but that I will also use them to deliver on any promise – however extravagantly generous it may seem – that I might make to you tonight?</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> Well, if you really were an Operator from the Seventh Dimension as you assert, then I suppose it’s not such a stretch to suppose that you might also be right in this additional claim. So, I’d say one in 10 quadrillion.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Good. Now we will do some maths. Let us say that the 10 livres that you have in your wallet are worth to you the equivalent of one happy day. Let’s call this quantity of good 1 Util. So I ask you to give up 1 Util. In return, I could promise to perform the magic tomorrow that will give you an extra 10 quadrillion happy days, i.e. 10 quadrillion Utils. Since you say there is a 1 in 10 quadrillion probability that I will fulfil my promise, this would be a fair deal. The expected Utility for you would be zero. But I feel generous this evening, and I will make you a better deal: If you hand me your wallet, I will perform magic that will give you an extra 1,000 quadrillion happy days of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> I admit I see no flaw in your mathematics.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> This is my final offer. You’re not going to pass up a deal that we have just calculated will give you an expected Utility surplus of nearly 100 Utils, are you? That’s the best offer you are likely to see this year.</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> Is this legitimate? You know, I’ve committed myself to trying to be a good Christian.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Of course it’s legitimate! Think of it as foreign trade. Your currency is worth a lot in the Seventh Dimension. By agreeing to this transaction, you give a major boost to our economy. Oh, and did I mention the children? If only you could see the faces of the sweet little orphans who will be made so much better off if we get this influx of hard currency – and there are so many of them, so very, very, very many . . . .</p>\n<p><strong>Pascal:</strong> I must confess: I’ve been having doubts about the mathematics of infinity. Infinite values lead to many strange conclusions and paradoxes. You know the reasoning that has come to be known as ‘Pascal’s Wager’? Between you and me, some of the critiques I’ve seen have made me wonder whether I might not be somehow confused about infinities or about the existence of infinite values . . .</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> I assure you, my powers are strictly finite. The offer before you does not involve infinite values in any way. But now I really must be off; I have an assignation in the Seventh Dimension that I’d rather not miss. Your wallet, please!</p>\n<p>Pascal hands over his wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>Mugger:</strong> Pleasure doing business. The magic will be performed tomorrow, as agreed.</p>\n","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"tpvP2TL2E4dQRQpiJ":2},"voteCount":5,"baseScore":9,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000066,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2021-10-04T15:34:12.373Z","name":"Pascal's mugging","slug":"pascal-s-mugging","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Pascal's mugging</strong> is a thought experiment intended to raise a problem for <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/expected-value\">expected value</a> theory. Unlike Pascal's wager, Pascal's mugging does not involve infinite utilities or probabilities, so the problem it raises is separate from any of the known paradoxes of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/infinite-ethics\">infinity</a>.</p><h2 id=\"The_thought_experiment\">The thought experiment</h2><p>The thought experiment and its name first appeared in a blog post by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/eliezer-yudkowsky\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyax64nzhlt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyax64nzhlt\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/nick-bostrom\">Nick Bostrom</a> later elaborated it in the form of a fictional dialogue.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc5ofd0wq9zv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc5ofd0wq9zv\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>In Yudkowsky's original formulation, a person is approached by a mugger who threatens to kill an astronomical number of people unless the person agrees to give them five dollars. Even a tiny probability assigned to the hypothesis that the mugger will deliver on his promise seems sufficient to make the prospect of giving the mugger five dollars better than the alternative, in expectation. The minuscule chance that the mugger is willing and able to save astronomically many people is more than compensated by the enormous value of what is at stake. (If one thinks the probability too low, the number of lives the mugger threatens to kill could be arbitrarily increased.) The thought experiment supposedly raises a problem for expected value theory because it seems intuitively absurd that we should give money to the mugger, yet this is what the theory apparently implies.</p><h2 id=\"Responses\">Responses</h2><p>A variety of responses have been developed. One common response is to revise or reject expected value theory. A frequent revision is to ignore scenarios whose probability is below a certain threshold.</p><p>This response, however, has a number of problems. One problem is that the threshold seems arbitrary, regardless of where it is set. A critic could always say: \"Why do you set the threshold at that value, rather than e.g. one order of magnitude higher or lower?\" A more fundamental problem is that it seems that whether a scenario falls below or above a certain threshold is contingent on how one carves up the space of possibilities. For example, an existential risk of 1-in-100 per century can be redescribed as an existential risk of 1-in-5.2 billion per minute. If the threshold is set to a value between those two numbers, whether one should or should not ignore the risk will depend merely on how one decides to describe it.</p><p>Another response is to adopt a prior that penalizes hypotheses in proportion to the number of people they imply we can affect. That is, one could adopt a view on which there is roughly a 1 in 10<sup>n</sup> chance that someone will have the power to affect 10<sup>n</sup> people. Given this penalty, the mugger can no longer resort to the trick of increasing the number of people they threaten to kill in order to make the offer sufficiently attractive. As the number of people increases, the probability that they will be killed by the mugger decreases correspondingly, and the expected value of their successive proposals remains the same.</p><p>A final response is to just \"bite the bullet\" and accept that if the mugger's proposal is better in expectation, one should indeed give them the five dollars. This approach becomes more plausible when combined with a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/debunking-argument\">debunking explanation</a> of the intuition that paying the mugger would be absurd. For example, one can argue that human brains cannot adequately represent very large or very small numbers, and that therefore intuitions triggered by thought experiments making use of such quantities are unreliable and should not be given much evidential weight.</p><h2 id=\"Implications\">Implications</h2><p>Regardless of how one responds to Pascal's mugging, it is important to note that it does not appear to affect the value assigned to \"high-stakes\" causes or interventions prioritized within the effective altruism community, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/ai-safety\">AI safety</a> research or other forms of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/existential-risk\">existential risk</a> mitigation. The case for working on these causes is not fundamentally different from more mundane arguments which we do not take to fall under the scope of Pascal's mugging, such as voting in an election.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbioy53c5fjb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbioy53c5fjb\">[3]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4mfyng7sa6k\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4mfyng7sa6k\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>It is also worth stressing that Pascal's mugging involves both very high stakes and very small probabilities, but the term is sometimes incorrectly applied to cases involving high stakes, regardless of their probability.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa2fb0yq3iig\"><sup><a href=\"#fna2fb0yq3iig\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Bostrom, Nick (2009) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/anp062\">Pascal’s mugging</a>, <i>Analysis</i>, vol. 69, pp. 443–445.</p><p>Yudkowsky, Eliezer (2007) <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a5JAiTdytou3Jg749/pascal-s-mugging-tiny-probabilities-of-vast-utilities\">Pascal’s mugging: tiny probabilities of vast utilities</a>, <i>LessWrong</i>, October 19.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/alternatives-to-expected-value-theory\">alternatives to expected value theory</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/altruistic-wager\">altruistic wager</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/decision-theory\">decision theory</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/fanaticism\">fanaticism</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/risk-aversion\">risk aversion</a></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnyax64nzhlt\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefyax64nzhlt\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Yudkowsky, Eliezer (2007) <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a5JAiTdytou3Jg749/pascal-s-mugging-tiny-probabilities-of-vast-utilities\">Pascal’s mugging: tiny probabilities of vast utilities</a>, <i>LessWrong</i>, October 19.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnc5ofd0wq9zv\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefc5ofd0wq9zv\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Bostrom, Nick (2009) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/anp062\">Pascal’s mugging</a>, <i>Analysis</i>, vol. 69, pp. 443–445.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnbioy53c5fjb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefbioy53c5fjb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Wiblin, Robert (2012) <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/if-elections-arent-a-pascals-mugging-existential-risk-shouldnt-be-either.html\">If elections aren’t a Pascal’s mugging, existential risk shouldn’t be either</a>, <i>Overcoming Bias</i>, September 27.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4mfyng7sa6k\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4mfyng7sa6k\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Wiblin, Robert (2015) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vYb2qEyqv76L62izD/saying-ai-safety-research-is-a-pascal-s-mugging-isn-t-a\">Saying ‘AI safety research is a Pascal’s Mugging’ isn’t a strong response</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>, December 15.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fna2fb0yq3iig\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefa2fb0yq3iig\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For discussion of a parallel misapplication of Pascal's wager, see Yudkowsky, Eliezer (2009) <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/pascals-wager-metafallacy.html\">The Pascal’s wager fallacy fallacy</a>, <i>Overcoming Bias</i>, March 17.</p></div></li></ol>","postCount":12,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"tpvP2TL2E4dQRQpiJ"}]},{"_id":"JMsJhxRbTnPuADdCi","postedAt":"2009-07-08T12:42:44.362Z","modifiedAt":"2021-12-08T02:15:36.746Z","title":"Brian Tomasik – The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2009-07-08T12:42:44.362Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JMsJhxRbTnPuADdCi/brian-tomasik-the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering","htmlBody":"<p><i>Request from author: please avoid crossposting the full essay (instead of e.g. posting a link with summary), as more copies means greater difficulty updating the content.

Therefore, animal advocates should consider focusing their efforts to raise concern about the suffering that occurs in the natural environment. While in theory this could involve trying directly to engineer more humane ecological systems, in practice I think activists should concentrate on promoting the meme of <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/caring-about-animal-suffering.html\">caring about</a> wild animals to other activists, academics, and other sympathetic groups. The massive amount of suffering occurring now in nature is indeed tragic, but it pales by comparison to the scale of good or harm that our descendants -- with advanced technological capability -- might effect.

Later, a statistician explained to John that because the disease is so rare, the chance that he had had the disease even <em>given</em> the positive test was less than one in a million.

Luckily, cognitive scientists know a great deal about the mathematics of <em>correct</em> thinking, how thinking errors are <em>produced</em>, and how we can <em>overcome</em> these errors in order to live more fulfilling lives.</p>\n<h2>Rationality</h2>\n<p>First, what is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/\">rationality</a>? It is not the same thing as intelligence, because even those with high intelligence fall prey to some thinking errors as often as everyone else.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-5\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-5\">[5]</a></sup> But then, what <em>is</em> rationality?</p>\n<p>Cognitive scientists recognize two kinds of rationality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Epistemic rationality</strong> is about forming true beliefs, about getting the <em>map in your head</em> to accurately reflect the <em>territory of the world</em>. We can measure epistemic rationality by comparing the rules of logic and probability theory to the way that a person <em>actually</em> updates their beliefs.</li>\n<li><strong>Instrumental rationality</strong> is about making decisions that are well-aimed at bringing about what you want. Due to habit and bias, many of our decisions don't actually align with our goals. We can measure instrumental rationality with a variety of techniques developed in economics, for example testing whether a person obeys the 'axioms of choice'.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-6\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-6\">[6]</a></sup>\nIn short, rationality improves our choices concerning what to believe and what to do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, human <em>irrationality</em> is quite common, as shown in popular books like <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kluge-Haphazard-Evolution-Human-Mind/dp/B002ECETZY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Ever since Aristotle spoke of humans as the \"rational animal,\" we've had a picture of ourselves as rational beings that are hampered by shortcomings like anger, fear, and confirmation bias.</p>\n<p>Cognitive science says just the opposite. Cognitive science shows us that humans just <em>are</em> a collection of messy little modules like anger and fear and the modules that produce confirmation bias. We have a <em>few</em> modules for processing logic and probability and rational goal-pursuit, but they are slow, energy-expensive, and rarely used.</p>\n<p>As we'll see, our brains avoid using these expensive modules whenever possible. Robert Boyd and Pete Richerson explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can get away with.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-7\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, as philosopher David Hull put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rule that human beings seem to follow is to engage [rational thought] only when all else fails — and usually not even then.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-8\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Human reasoning</h2>\n<p>So how does human reasoning work, and why does it so often produce mistaken judgments and decisions?</p>\n<p>Today, cognitive scientists talk about <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/\">two kinds</a> of processes, what Daniel Kahneman (2011) calls \"fast and slow\" processes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type 1 processes</strong> are fast, do not require conscious attention, do not need input from conscious processes, and can operate in parallel.</li>\n<li><strong>Type 2 processes</strong> are slow, require conscious effort, and generally only work one at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Type 1 processes provide judgments quickly, but these judgments are often wrong, and can be overridden by corrective Type 2 processes.</p>\n<p>Type 2 processes are computationally expensive, and thus humans are '<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/2ey/a_taxonomy_of_bias_the_cognitive_miser/\">cognitive misers</a>'. This means that we (1) default to Type 1 processes whenever possible, and (2) when we <em>must</em> use Type 2 processes, we use the least expensive kinds of Type 2 processes, those with a 'focal bias' — a disposition to reason from the <em>simplest</em> model available instead of considering all the relevant factors. Hence, we are subject to confirmation bias (our cognition is focused on what we already believe) and other biases.</p>\n<p>So, cognitive miserliness can cause three types of thinking errors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We default to Type 1 processes when Type 2 processes are needed.</li>\n<li>We fail to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes.</li>\n<li>Even when we override with Type 2 processes, we use Type 2 processes with focal bias.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the problem gets worse. If someone is going to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes, then she also needs the right <em>content</em> available with which to do the overriding. For example, she may need to override a biased intuitive judgment with a correct application of probability theory, or a correct application of deductive logic. Such tools are called '<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/2fj/a_taxonomy_of_bias_mindware_problems/\">mindware</a>'.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-9\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Thus, thinking can also go wrong if there is a 'mindware gap' — that is, if an agent lacks crucial mindware like probability theory.</p>\n<p>Finally, thinking can go wrong due to 'contaminated mindware' — mindware that exists but is <em>wrong</em>. For example, an agent may have the naive belief that they know their own minds quite well, which is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/5sk/inferring_our_desires/\">false</a>. Such mistaken mindware can lead to mistaken judgments.</p>\n<h2>Types of errors</h2>\n<p>Given this understanding, a taxonomy of thinking errors could begin like this:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-10\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/b1hvTmT/Pic-1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The circles on the left capture the three normal sources of thinking errors. The three rectangles to the right of 'Cognitive Miserliness' capture the three categories of error that can be caused by cognitive miserliness. The <em>rounded</em> rectangles to the right of 'Mindware Gap' and 'Corrupted Mindware' propose some <em>examples</em> of (1) mindware that, if missing, can cause a mindware gap, and (2) common contaminated mindware.</p>\n<p>The process for solving a reasoning task, then, may look something like this:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-11\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-11\">[11]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/ZY3Bhq5/Pic-2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>First, do I have mindware available to solve the reasoning problem before me with slow, deliberate, Type 2 processes? If not, my brain must use fast but inaccurate Type 1 processes to solve the problem. If I do have mindware available to solve this problem, do I notice the need to engage it? If not, my brain defaults to the cheaper Type 1 processes. If I <em>do</em> notice the need to engage Type 2 processes and have the necessary mindware, is <em>sustained</em> (as opposed to momentary) 'Type 2 override' required to solve the problem? If not, then I use that mindware to solve the problem. If sustained override <em>is</em> required to solve the reasoning problem and I don't have the cognitive capacity (e.g. working memory) needed to complete the override, then my brain will default back to Type 1 processes. Otherwise, I'll use my cognitive capacities to sustain Type 2 override well enough to complete the reasoning task with my Type 2 processes (mindware).</p>\n<p>That may be something like how our brains determine how to solve a reasoning task.</p>\n<p>It's this model that Stanovich and colleagues (2010) use to explain why, among other things, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tasks-that-do-and-do-not-correlate-with-cognitive-ability.pdf\">IQ is correlated with performance on some reasoning tasks but not others</a>. For example, IQ correlates with performance on tests of outcome bias and hindsight bias, but not with performance on tests of anchoring effects and omission bias. To overcome these latter biases, subjects seem to need not just high cognitive capacity (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence\">fluid intelligence</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory\">working memory</a>, etc.), but also specific rationality training.</p>\n<p>If this is right, then we may talk of three different 'minds' at work in solving reasoning problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <em>autonomous</em> mind, made of unconscious Type 1 processes. There are few individual differences in its operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <em>algorithmic</em> mind, made of conscious Type 2 processes. There are significant individual differences in fluid intelligence in particular and cognitive capacity in general — that is, differences in perceptual speed, discrimination accuracy, working memory capacity, and the efficiency of the retrieval of information stored in long-term memory.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-12\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <em>reflective mind</em>, which shows individual differences in the disposition to use rationality mindware — the disposition to generate alternative hypotheses, to use fully disjunctive reasoning, to engage in actively open-minded thinking, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-13\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Rationality Skills</strong></h4>\n<p>But it is not enough to understand how the human brain produces thinking errors. We also must find ways to meliorate the problem if we want to have more accurate beliefs and more efficiently achieve our goals. As Milkman et al. (2010) say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the time has come to move the study of biases in judgment and decision making beyond description and toward the development of improvement strategies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stanovich (2009) sums up our project:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To jointly achieve epistemic and instrumental rationality, a person must display judicious decision making, adequate behavioral regulation, wise goal prioritization, sufficient thoughtfulness, and proper evidence calibration. For example, epistemic rationality — beliefs that are properly matched to the world — requires probabilistic reasoning and the ability to calibrate theories to evidence. Instrumental rationality — maximizing goal fulfillment — requires adherence to all of the axioms of rational choice. People fail to fulfill the many different strictures of rational thought because they are cognitive misers, because they lack critical mindware, and because they have acquired contaminated mindware. These errors can be prevented by acquiring the mindware of rational thought and the thinking dispositions that prevent the overuse of the strategies of the cognitive miser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the project of 'debiasing' ourselves<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-14\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-14\">[14]</a></sup> with 'ameliorative psychology'.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-15\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-15\">[15]</a></sup></p>\n<p>What we want is a <strong>Rationality Toolkit</strong>: a set of skills and techniques that can be used to overcome and correct the errors of our primate brains so we can form more accurate beliefs and make better decisions.</p>\n<p>Our goal is not unlike Carl Sagan's '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUB4j0n2UDU\">Baloney Detection Kit</a>', but the tools in our Rationality Toolkit will be more specific and better grounded in the cognitive science of rationality.</p>\n<p>I mentioned some examples of debiasing interventions that have been tested by experimental psychologists in my post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/76x/is_rationality_teachable/\">Is Rationality Teachable?</a> I'll start with those, then add a few techniques for ameliorating the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/jg/planning_fallacy/\">planning fallacy</a>, and we've got the beginnings of our Rationality Toolkit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A simple instruction to \"think about alternatives\" can promote resistance to overconfidence and confirmation bias. In one study, subjects asked to generate their own hypotheses are more responsive to their accuracy than subjects asked to choose from among pre-picked hypotheses.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-16\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-16\">[16]</a></sup> Another study required subjects to list reasons for and against each of the possible answers to each question on a quiz prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This process resulted in more accurate confidence judgments relative to a control group.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-17\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-17\">[17]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Training in microeconomics can help subjects avoid the sunk cost fallacy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-18\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-18\">[18]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Because people avoid the base rate fallacy more often when they encounter problems phrased in terms of frequencies instead of probabilities,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-19\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-19\">[19]</a></sup> teaching people to translate probabilistic reasoning tasks into frequency formats improves their performance.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-20\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-20\">[20]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Warning people about biases can decrease their prevalence. So far, this has been demonstrated to work with regard to framing effects,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-21\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-21\">[21]</a></sup> hindsight bias,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-22\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-22\">[22]</a></sup> and the outcome effect,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-23\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-23\">[23]</a></sup> though attempts to mitigate anchoring effects by warning people about them have produced weak results so far.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-24\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-24\">[24]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Research on the planning fallacy suggests that taking an 'outside view' when predicting the time and resources required to complete a task will lead to better predictions. A specific instance of this strategy is 'reference class forecasting',<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-25\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-25\">[25]</a></sup> in which planners project time and resource costs for a project by basing their projections on the outcomes of a distribution of comparable projects.</li>\n<li>Unpacking the components involved in a large task or project helps people to see more clearly how much time and how many resources will be required to complete it, thereby partially meliorating the planning fallacy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-26\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-26\">[26]</a></sup></li>\n<li>One reason we fall prey to the planning fallacy is that we do not remain as focused on the task at hand throughout its execution as when we are planning its execution. The planning fallacy can be partially meliorated, then, not only by improving the planning but by improving the execution. For example, in one study<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-27\" id=\"fnref-ETotYQmrKgzCNzw6Z-27\">[27]</a></sup> students were taught to imagine themselves performing each of the steps needed to complete a project. Participants rehearsed these simulations each day. 41% of these students completed their tasks on time, compared to 14% in a control group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But this is <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/5x8/teachable_rationality_skills/\">only the start</a>. We need more rationality skills, and we need step-by-step instructions for how to teach them and how to implement them at the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/\">5-second level</a>.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Ackerman, Kyllonen &amp; Richards, eds.

(2008) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cognitive scientists recognize two types of rationality: instrumental and epistemic... [We] could characterize instrumental rationality as the optimization of the individual’s goal fulfillment. Economists and cognitive scientists have reﬁned the notion of optimization of goal fulfillment into the technical notion of expected utility. The model of rational judgment used by decision scientists is one in which a person chooses options based on which option has the largest expected utility...\nThe other aspect of rationality studied by cognitive scientists is termed epistemic rationality. This aspect of rationality concerns how well beliefs map onto the actual structure of the world. Instrumental and epistemic rationality are related. The aspect of beliefs that enter into instrumental calculations (i.e., tacit calculations) are the probabilities of states of affairs in the world.\nAlso see the discussion in Stanovich et al. (2011). On instrumental rationality as the maximization of expected utility, see Dawes (1998); Hastie &amp; Dawes (2009); Wu et al. (2004). On epistemic reality, see Foley (1987); Harman (1995); Manktelow (2004); Over (2004).\nHow can we measure an individual's divergence from expected utility maximization if we can't yet measure utility directly? One of the triumphs of decision science is the demonstration that agents whose behavior respects the so-called 'axioms of choice' will behave as if they are maximizing expected utility. It can be difficult to measure utility, but it is easier to measure whether one of the axioms of choice are being violated, and thus whether an agent is behaving instrumentally irrationally.\nViolations of both instrumental and epistemic rationality have been catalogued at length by cognitive psychologists in the 'heuristics and biases' literature: Baron (2007); Evans (1989, 2007); Gilovich et al.

In fact, Peter Singer and Peter Unger argue that we ought to give a <em>lot</em>.&#xA0; They don&#x2019;t specify a figure, but let&#x2019;s pick, just for the sake of having a nice round number, 50% of one&#x2019;s annual wage.</p><p>The standard response to the views of Singer and Unger, in the philosophical literature, is that giving such extortionate sums is just <em>too</em> demanding for it to be plausible as a moral requirement.</p><p>But is giving this much really too demanding?&#xA0; I&#x2019;ll suggest not, for two reasons.</p><p>\nFirst, you&#x2019;re probably richer than you think.&#xA0; If you are earning &#xA3;40 000/yr, you&#x2019;re easily in the richest 1% of the world&#x2019;s population; if you were to give half that, you&#x2019;d still be in the richest 2%.&#xA0; If you&#x2019;re earning &#xA3;20 000 and were to give 50%, you&#x2019;d still be in the richest 8%.</p><p>Imagine if, before you were born, when you didn&#x2019;t know who you were going to be in society, you got told you were going to end up in the richest 10% of the world&#x2019;s population.&#xA0; Would you be happy?&#xA0; You&#x2019;d be over the moon!&#xA0; But if that&#x2019;s true, how could we complain about <em>merely</em> living in the richest 10%?</p><p>You might think that, well, the money goes much further in poor countries &#x2013; so having a lower wage isn&#x2019;t so bad if you live there, and so the figures I&#x2019;ve given are skewed.&#xA0; But those figures I&#x2019;ve given are &#x2018;purchasing power parity&#x2019; adjusted &#x2013; that is, they&#x2019;ve already taken into account the fact that money goes farther in poor countries.&#xA0; Some people are <em>poor</em>!</p><p>Second, the latest psychological research suggests that, despite what you may think, income level really doesn&#x2019;t make much of a difference to your overall happiness. Once we&#x2019;ve got the basics in life &#x2013; food, water and shelter &#x2013; then other things, like health and relationships, become much more important. In particular, it&#x2019;s been found that &#x2018;prosocial&#x2019; spending of money &#x2013; for example, giving the money to people more in need &#x2013; provides a &#x2018;warm glow&#x2019; that can keep you happy for weeks.</p><p>In fact, rather than being insanely demanding, giving away large chunks of your income will actually have very little effect on your wellbeing, and may well be a net benefit.</p><p>So giving really isn&#x2019;t demanding.&#xA0; This year, let&#x2019;s put ethics into practice, and make the world a little better: <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto/donate\">http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto/donate</a>\n</p><p>Merry Christmas!</p><p></p><p>\n*More information on these and related topics can be found at <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">www.givingwhatwecan.org</a></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"tmQ7kd3bFTnSQveDv":2,"oEvBquSzz56ts7pEn":2,"TeppgEYmJoE5hoq3S":2,"FtscHgKMASeoT5sPu":2},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":4,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000061,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T11:29:32.672Z","name":"Philosophy of effective altruism","slug":"philosophy-of-effective-altruism","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>Philosophy of effective altruism</strong> tag covers posts about the philosophical ideas behind EA, especially when they don't discuss particular causes or research methods.</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>MacAskill, William &amp; Darius Meissner (2020) <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/acting-on-utilitarianism#effective-altruism\">Effective altruism</a>, in 'Acting on utilitarianism', <i>Utilitarianism</i>.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/philosophy\">philosophy</a></p>","postCount":87,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"tmQ7kd3bFTnSQveDv"},{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:26:53.080Z","name":"Moral philosophy","slug":"moral-philosophy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>moral philosophy</strong> tag is very wide-ranging, and can be used alongside more specific tags like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/philosophy-of-effective-altruism\">philosophy of effective altruism</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/longtermism\">longtermism</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/moral-patienthood\">moral patienthood</a>.</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Parfit, Derek (1984) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-824908-X\"><i>Reasons and Persons</i></a>, Oxford: Clarendon press.</p><p>Sidgwick, Henry (1907) <i>The Methods of Ethics</i>, 7th ed., London: Macmillan.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/applied-ethics\">applied ethics</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/infinite-ethics\">infinite ethics</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/metaethics\">metaethics</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/normative-ethics\">normative ethics</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/philosophy\">philosophy</a></p>","postCount":244,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"oEvBquSzz56ts7pEn"},{"createdAt":"2021-07-08T14:56:51.638Z","name":"Giving and happiness","slug":"giving-and-happiness-1","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Giving and happiness</strong> refers to the apparent causal relationship that exists between prosocial spending and subjective wellbeing.</p><p>When a person donates money that they could have spent on themselves, the resulting change in wellbeing depends not only on the welfare loss from forgone self-interested spending, but also on possible welfare gains associated with the perception that the spending will help other people or promote a worthy cause.

In order to make the advice practical, it typically takes empirical uncertainty into account.  For example, we don&#x2019;t currently know exactly to what extent the earth&#x2019;s temperature will rise, if we are to continue to emit CO2 at the rate we have been emitting so far.  The temperature rise might be small, in which case the consequences would not be dire.  Or the temperature rise might be very great, in which case the consequences could be catastrophic.  To what extent we ought to mitigate our CO2 emissions depends crucially on this factual question.  But it&#x2019;s of course not true that we are unable to offer any practical advice in absence of knowledge concerning this factual question. It&#x2019;s just that our advice will concern what one ought to do in light of uncertainty about the facts.\n \nBut if practical ethics should take empirical uncertainty into account, surely it should take moral uncertainty into account as well.  In many situations, we don&#x2019;t know all the moral facts.  I think it is fair to say, for example, that we don&#x2019;t currently know exactly how to weigh the interests of future generations against the interests of current generations.  But this issue is just as relevant to the question of how one ought to act in response to climate change as is the issue of expected temperature rise.  If the ethics of climate change offers advice about how best to act given empirical uncertainty concerning global temperature rise, it should also offer advice about how best to act, given uncertainty concerning the value of future generations.\n \nCases such as the above aren&#x2019;t rare.  Given the existence of widespread disagreement within ethics, and given the difficulty of the subject-matter, we would be overconfident if we were to claim to be 100% certain in our favoured moral view, especially when it comes to the difficult issues that ethicists often discuss.</p><p>So we need to have an account of how one ought to act under moral uncertainty.  The standard account of making decisions under uncertainty is that you ought to <em>maximise expected value</em>: look at all hypotheses in which you have some degree of belief, work out the likelihood of each hypothesis, work out how much value would be at stake if that hypothesis were true, and then trade off the probability of a hypothesis being true against how much would be at stake, if it were true.  One implication of maximizing expected value is that sometimes one should refrain from a course of action, not on the basis that it will probably be a bad thing to do, but rather because there is a reasonable chance that it will be a bad thing to do, and that, if it&#x2019;s bad thing to do, then it&#x2019;s really bad.  So, for example, you ought not to speed round blind corners: the reason why isn&#x2019;t because it&#x2019;s likely that you will run someone over if you do so.  Rather, the reason is that there&#x2019;s some chance that you will &#x2013; and it would be seriously bad if you did.</p><p>With this on board, let&#x2019;s think about the practical implications of maximising expected value under moral uncertainty.   It seems that the implications are pretty clear in a number of cases. Here are a few.</p><p>1. One might think it more likely than not that it&#x2019;s not wrong to kill animals for food.  But one shouldn&#x2019;t be certain that it&#x2019;s not wrong.  And, if it is wrong, then it&#x2019;s seriously wrong &#x2013; <a href=\"http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer02.htm\">in the same ballpark as murder</a>. So, in killing an animal, one risks performing a major moral wrong, without any correspondingly great potential moral upside.  This would be morally reckless.  So one ought not to kill animals for food.</p><p>2. One might think it more likely than not that it&#x2019;s not wrong to have an abortion, for reasons of convenience.  But one shouldn&#x2019;t be certain that it&#x2019;s not wrong.  And, if it is wrong, then it&#x2019;s seriously wrong &#x2013; <a href=\"http://rci.rutgers.edu/~tripmcc/phil/cmsi/csmi-abortion/marquis-whyabortionisimmoral.pdf\">in the same ballpark as murder</a>.  So, in having an abortion for convenience, one risks performing a major moral wrong, without any correspondingly great potential moral upside.  This would be morally reckless.  So one ought not to have an abortion for reasons of convenience.</p><p>3. One might think it more likely than not that it&#x2019;s not wrong to spend money on luxuries, rather than giving it to fight extreme poverty.  But one shouldn&#x2019;t be certain that it&#x2019;s not wrong.  And, if it is wrong, then it&#x2019;s seriously wrong &#x2013; <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm\">in the same ballpark as walking past a child drowning in a shallow pond</a>. So, in spending money on luxuries, one risks performing a major moral wrong, without any correspondingly great potential moral upside.  This would be morally reckless.  So one ought not to spend money on luxuries rather than giving that money to fight poverty.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"oEvBquSzz56ts7pEn":2,"8sbHXePJ4L5o8G5aM":2},"voteCount":13,"baseScore":22,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000142,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:26:53.080Z","name":"Moral philosophy","slug":"moral-philosophy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>moral philosophy</strong> tag is very wide-ranging, and can be used alongside more specific tags like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/philosophy-of-effective-altruism\">philosophy of effective altruism</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/longtermism\">longtermism</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/moral-patienthood\">moral patienthood</a>.</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Parfit, Derek (1984) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-19-824908-X\"><i>Reasons and Persons</i></a>, Oxford: Clarendon press.</p><p>Sidgwick, Henry (1907) <i>The Methods of Ethics</i>, 7th ed., London: Macmillan.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/applied-ethics\">applied ethics</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/infinite-ethics\">infinite ethics</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/metaethics\">metaethics</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/normative-ethics\">normative ethics</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/philosophy\">philosophy</a></p>","postCount":244,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"oEvBquSzz56ts7pEn"},{"createdAt":"2020-08-12T08:26:10.599Z","name":"Moral uncertainty","slug":"moral-uncertainty","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Moral uncertainty</strong> is uncertainty about how to act given lack of certainty in any one moral theory, as well as the study of how we ought to act given this uncertainty.</p><p>We are sometimes uncertain about empirical facts, such as whether it will rain tomorrow.

Most <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=philanthropy&amp;x=6&amp;y=26\">books on philanthropy</a> are how-to’s rather than histories, and most of the histories don’t appear to focus on listing specific cases where foundations had (or failed to have) impact. One exception is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Casebook-Foundation-Great-American-Secret/dp/1586484885/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329784288&amp;sr=1-1\">the Casebook for <i>The Foundation: A Great American Secret</i></a>, which lists and discusses “100 of the highest-achieving foundation initiatives” since 1900.</p><p>I thoroughly examined this volume, and collected some basic notes into a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/attachments/casebook%20notes%20-%20for%20publication.xls\">spreadsheet</a>. My reflections follow. In brief, I felt there were some very strong cases here, particularly in the area of medical research, and I was surprised by philanthropy’s history of being active in shaping various graduate education programs. At the same time, I thought the Casebook’s history had important shortcomings - in particular, not putting successes in context along with failures - and I see a lot of room for improvement in the amount of information available about the history of philanthropic successes and failures.</p><p>Note that I am not well-informed about most of the cases discussed here and have relied on the Casebook for my information. The notes that follow <strong>are only loose impressions and are not backed by the sort of evidence that we usually seek (even for blog posts).</strong></p><p><strong>Philanthropy has some extremely impressive accomplishments.</strong> Among other things, foundations have been (in my view) reasonably credited for leading the way on building schools and hospitals in the rural Southern U.S., piloting the shoulder line on U.S. roads, successfully advocating for federal legislation in areas including health care for the homeless and nuclear deproliferation, the research that led to the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/03/16/can-the-green-revolution-be-repeated-in-africa/\">Green Revolution</a>, and many major advances in medical research (including the first combination drug therapy for AIDS and the development of the pap smear). There are many other projects that sound like they may have been impactful, but which the Casebook doesn’t give enough context on for me to have a strong view.</p><p><strong>The most impressive cases (in my view) are mostly the earlier ones.</strong> Though the Casebook focuses on more recent philanthropy (78 of its 100 cases are post-1950), 9 of the 14 cases I found most impressive are pre-1950 (and a 10th is from 1952).</p><p>A possible explanation is that <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/06/11/why-we-should-expect-good-giving-to-be-hard/\">the space of doing good has become more crowded</a> over time. For example, note that</p><ul><li>Total U.S. government health spending was 0.26% of GDP in 1902 and 0.92% of GDP in 1950; by contrast, in 2009, it was 7.06% of GDP (these figures are in the spreadsheet linked above), and even most <i>developing</i> countries spend 2%+ of GDP on in this area (<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PUBL.ZS\">source</a>). In 1927, the Commonwealth Fund piloted a rural hospital program; there aren’t a lot of “philanthropic opportunities” that look like that today.</li><li>Total U.S. government education spending was 1.07% of GDP in 1902 and 3.28% of GDP in 1950; by contrast, in 2009, it was 6.16% of GDP (these figures are in the spreadsheet linked above), and even most <i>developing</i> countries spend 3%+ of GDP on in this area (<a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PUBL.ZS\">source</a>). In 1902, the Rockefeller Foundation funded advocacy for providing public schools in the U.S. South; there aren’t a lot of “philanthropic opportunities” that look like that today.</li><li>More context: The Department of Education was created in 1979, the National Science Foundation was created in 1950, and the National Institutes of Health began in 1930 (but have grown significantly since; in fact one of the “success stories” in the Casebook discusses the growth of the NIH budget from $2.4 million in 1945 to $5.5 billion in 1985).</li></ul><p><strong>The most impressive achievements (in my view) are concentrated in the sectors of research (particularly medical research) and health care.</strong> In part, these reflect the fact that achievements in these two fields tend to be unusually tangible. However, it’s worth noting that many of the cases discussed in the Casebook have had decades to show a tangible impact on policy and institutions.</p><p><strong>Foundations have a long history of influencing the curricula of colleges and graduate schools.</strong> I was surprised by how many of the cases fell into this category (marked “graduate education” or “undergraduate education” in the spreadsheet linked above) because I rarely hear about it in the context of modern philanthropy. While in most cases the long-term impact of foundations’ work in this area remains unclear, they appear to have had a lot of highly tangible proximate success, i.e., they have succeeded in getting universities to follow the paths they’ve advocated for.</p><p><strong>Some “philanthropic success stories” may have created institutions that have now outlived their purpose.</strong> For example, the National Merit Scholarship Corporation was created in 1955; at that time, “38 percent of students in the top 2 percent of intelligence quotients were not pursuing a college education” and the scholarships it offered may have been highly impactful. Today, my impression of National Merit Scholarships is that they are small compared to college tuition (<a href=\"https://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/interior.aspx?sid=1758&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=424\">$2500</a>) and that they are fungible with need-based aid; they therefore don’t seem to impact people’s ability to attend college.</p><p><strong>I see impressive choices of causes and organizations; I don’t see impressive “tactics,” i.e., choices of projects or theories of change.</strong> This may simply be a reflection of the Casebook’s choice of approach and focus. There are many cases in which I found myself agreeing with the Casebook that a foundation had chosen an important and overlooked problem to put its money toward, but few (if any) cases where its strategy <i>within</i> the sector seemed particularly intricate, clever, noteworthy or crucial to its success. The spreadsheet above categorizes grants both by “sector” and by “type of grantmaking”; there is a surprising (to me) amount of variety when it comes to the former, and not as much when it comes to the latter.</p><p>My intuition is that the choice of sector is the most important choice a funder makes.</p><p><strong>Two particular approaches - “blue-ribbon panels” and pilots for government programs - were common in early philanthropy, but have recently been more rare (at least among success stories).</strong> Regarding the former: the Casebook gives the impression that in some early cases, a foundation was the first/only agent to commission a “blue-ribbon panel” to produce a report on, e.g., medical or legal education, and that the report was eagerly awaited and garnered instant attention. Today, my impression is that it is very common for foundations to produce these sorts of reports, but that getting people to pay attention to them is more of an uphill battle.</p><p><strong>Strong patterns emerge when one asks, “Why was philanthropy needed here - why didn’t beneficiaries create change for themselves?”</strong> We’ve <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/06/11/why-we-should-expect-good-giving-to-be-hard/\">written previously</a> that there are many mechanisms for helping people other than philanthropy. In Column J, I tried to summarize the relevant properties of a project’s “constituency” (the people who stood to benefit from it) with an eye toward explaining why this constituency didn’t address (or wasn’t perceived to have addressed) its own needs, leading to a (perceived) need for philanthropy. I found that the following situations were common:</p><ul><li>Many projects’ primary constituencies were disadvantaged people (18 cases) or the environment (8 cases); it is easy to see why these constituencies wouldn’t create change for themselves.</li><li>Many projects were focused on funding research for public consumption (24 cases) or on funding/improving education (27 cases). In theory, there are incentives for people to work on improving their own education (or their children’s) and there are incentives to do research; but in practice the connection between investment and reward may be weak enough that these links often break. (Research is also a global public good: when it is disseminated publicly, most of the benefits of the research cannot be captured by those who paid for it. Note that there are other kinds of public goods, such as parks, that seem less of a fit for large-scale philanthropy since they can be supported by community- or government-level philanthropy.)</li><li>2 projects focused on educating the general public on health; 1 advocated for increased government support for public radio; 3 focused on facilitating coordination between nations (e.g., nuclear deproliferation); 2 couldn’t be categorized because the projects were too general in scope.</li><li>The remaining projects present, in my view, the most puzzling cases in terms of this question. There were 6 cases in which philanthropic funding led to the creation of organizations or movements that eventually came to be supported directly by their customers or communities (such as Blue Cross Blue Shield and Grameen Bank); there were 8 cases in which philanthropy focused on improving the general efficacy of government services. These were cases in which philanthropists may have found (or believed they had found) that <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/06/11/why-we-should-expect-good-giving-to-be-hard/\">other actors</a> were fulfilling their roles suboptimally.</li></ul><p><strong>The Casebook has major biases and limitations, and there could be many impressive cases that it does not reveal</strong> (either by not covering them or by not discussing them convincingly enough).</p><ul><li>It often makes a thin case, or no case, for the big-picture impact of a foundation’s work. Chapter 71, on the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s collection and publication of data on well-being of U.S. children, is a particularly vivid example of this: it seems a case for impact might be possible to make but the book makes no attempt to do so.</li><li>It seems overly eager to ascribe positive impact to a foundation’s work, and to overlook possible negative/offsetting impact. For example, in Chapter 24, it implicitly credits the Rockefeller Foundation’s work on studying population for subsequent slowing of population growth (the latter has many other, and I believe stronger, candidates for explanation).</li><li>It seems very focused on large foundations (in Chapter 40, only the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation appears in the chapter headline, even though three other foundations are given credit for being the earlier seed funding for the project discussed).</li><li>It also seems to place a heavy emphasis on “innovative work” rather than on results (for example, Chapter 92 emphasizes the dramatic change and unusual approach the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation took in funding the Nurse-Family Partnership, Harlem Children’s Zone, and Youth Villages, but does not discuss the evidence - which I independently believe to be reasonably strong by the standards of U.S. social programs - that these programs have been impactful).</li></ul><p><strong>The Casebook is the best resource I’ve found for getting a sense of the history of philanthropy, but its usefulness is severely limited by the lack of “failure stories” and the lack of dissenting perspectives.</strong> Which of these cases are widely/consensually believed to have had strong impact, and which are simply admired by the Casebook’s authors? How many failures accompanied the listed successes for each foundation, for each sector? Without this information, it’s not possible to get a real sense of “what’s worked and what hasn’t” in philanthropy.</p><p>I don’t think the Casebook authors can be blamed for this situation. The larger issue is that foundations publish very little of substance on the case for their work’s impact (or lack thereof). We don’t want to go into <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/announcing-givewell-labs\">GiveWell Labs</a> with so little historical context, but unfortunately it looks like we will have to. Hopefully, future philanthropists will be more easily able to learn from our work.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"toct8RYvTvgontEts":1,"RNRbmXTqXb2Lc9pih":1},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":3,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.00006253424903431144,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-12-22T14:44:38.117Z","name":"Open Philanthropy","slug":"open-philanthropy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> (previously the <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>) is a research and grantmaking foundation based in San Francisco.</p><h2 id=\"History\">History</h2><p>Open Philanthropy launched in late 2011, as a partnership between <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/good-ventures\">Good Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell\">GiveWell</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftgc02qi0fmg\"><sup><a href=\"#fntgc02qi0fmg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The partnership operated under the name <strong>GiveWell Labs</strong> before adopting, in August 2014, the name <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4vww1w7m4ep\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4vww1w7m4ep\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It continued to be part of GiveWell until 2017, when it became an independent organization.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh926zy6ps5f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh926zy6ps5f\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The name was changed to <strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> around December 2019.</p><h2 id=\"Leadership\">Leadership</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/cari-tuna\">Cari Tuna</a> is Open Philanthropy's president, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/holden-karnofsky\">Holden Karnofsky</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/alexander-berger\">Alexander Berger</a> are its two co-CEOs.

That&#x2019;s an understatement. It might therefore be surprising to think of a career as a philosopher as a potentially high impact ethical career - the sort of career that enables one to do a huge amount of good in the world. But I don&#x2019;t think that philosophy&#x2019;s impracticality is in the nature of the subject-matter. In fact, I think that research within certain areas of philosophy is among some of the most important and practical research that one can do. This shouldn&#x2019;t be surprising when one considers that philosophy is the only subject that addresses directly the fundamental practical question: what ought I to do?</p>\n\n<p>In this post I&#x2019;ll focus in on normative ethics, practical ethics, and decision theory. Within these areas, I&#x2019;m going to give a recipe for choosing research topics, if one wants to maximise the practical importance of one&#x2019;s work as a philosopher. Here it goes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by asking &#x2018;which issues might conceivably be the most important moral issue that we currently face?&#x2019;</li>\n\n<li>Then ask &#x2018;what are the crucial normative considerations for determining which of these issues really is the most important?&#x2019;</li>\n\n<li>Then figure out which of these crucial considerations is most likely to produce an action-relevant outcome given your marginal research time?</li>\n\n<li>Then work on that topic!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That was the outline. It&#x2019;s by no means a perfect methodology, and there are many ways in which it could be expanded upon. Its main point is to give one the gist, and hopefully to make one wonder about why research topics within ethics aren&#x2019;t typically chosen in the above way. In the rest of the post I&#x2019;ll briefly flesh out these different steps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. What&#x2019;s the list of the conceivably most important current moral issues?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are many problems in the world, and there are many ways of carving up the space of &#x2018;problems&#x2019;. I&#x2019;ll talk about these issues in a later post. But, in the mean time, here are a few contenders:</p>\n\n<p>i. Global poverty</p>\n\n<p><em>Why?</em></p>\n\n<p>Currently 1.4 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day, purchasing power parity adjusted (that is: they consume fewer goods than $1.25 could buy in the US in 2005). 18 million people die per year of poverty-related causes - that&#x2019;s about one third of all human deaths.</p>\n\n<p>ii. Abortion</p>\n\n<p><em>Why?</em></p>\n\n<p>Around 42 million abortions are performed per year. Many people think that a fetus has similar rights to an adult person, in which case performing an abortion would be roughly on a par, morally, with murder. To get a sense of scale on this issue, consider that if this were true then the murder toll from the government sanction of abortions would outstrip all previous genocides combined.</p>\n\n<p>iii. Animal suffering and slaughter</p>\n\n<p><em>Why?</em></p>\n\n<p>A staggering 50 billion non-human land animals are killed every year for food. A large proportion of those animals are factory farmed, living in extreme suffering. There are compelling arguments to the conclusion that we should treat non-human animal suffering as being on a par, morally, as human animal suffering. If this were true, then the annual animal suffering caused by humans could easily outweigh all human suffering.</p>\n\n<p>iv. The risk of human extinction</p>\n\n<p><em>Why?</em></p>\n\n<p>The number of people who might live in the future, if we survive the next few centuries, numbers in the trillions (consider that, if humans live at current population levels for the average lifespan of a mammalian species, then there are over 10^13 (or ten trillion) humans in the future). If we ought, morally, to value potential future people in the same way that we value present people, then the loss from the human race going extinct in the near future might number in the trillions of lives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What are the crucial normative considerations?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It would be controversial to claim, of any of the above issues, that it is the most important moral issue that we face. Even if we knew all the empirical facts, there would still remain tricky moral issues &#x2013; moral considerations that are crucial insofar as, if we knew the right opinion on the matter, we could write off certain of the above issues as not of the greatest importance.</p>\n\n<p>There are many we could put on the list. But the list would certainly include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How should we value future people, and merely possible people, compared with present people? (Relevant to abortion, animal suffering, extinction risk)</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>What moral status do non-human animals have, and how should we make inter-species comparisons of wellbeing? (Relevant to animal suffering)</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>At what stage does a human fetus become a person, with rights to life similar to that of an adult? (Relevant to abortion)</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>How should we act under empirical uncertainty &#x2013; in particular should we follow expected utility even when it comes to tiny probabilities of huge amounts of value? (Relevant to extinction risk)</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>All other things being equal, should we prioritise the prevention of wrongs over the alleviation of naturally caused suffering? (Relevant to abortion, animal suffering)</p>\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<p>Given that we aren&#x2019;t ever going to be certain in answers to the above questions, how should we take into account uncertainty about these moral issues in our decision-making? (Relevant to: global poverty, abortion, animal suffering, extinction risk)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. Which topic would be advanced the most from one&#x2019;s marginal research time?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This one is more dependent on one&#x2019;s own abilities and interests. But, in general, we could suppose that research time on a particular topic has diminishing marginal value.

In a nutshell:</p><ul><li>Some are concerned that <strong>we’ll lose our objectivity if we get involved in providing restricted funding:</strong> we’ll be tempted to rank the groups following our plans ahead of the groups following their own plans, and we’ll thus lose the quality of being a disinterested third-party evaluator. We believe we can draw a meaningful line between “charities we recommend for unrestricted funding” and “plans we have designed,” leaving individual donors to decide whether they’d rather take our recommendation unconditionally or only follow our advice in the areas where we’re disinterested; we also believe that being open to providing restricted funding is necessary and important, and justifies the resources we’ll be investing. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/objections-and-concerns-about-our-new-direction#Objectivity\">More</a></li><li>Some are concerned that by going into new causes, we’ll be <strong>spreading ourselves too thin</strong>. Understanding global health is already an ambitious and difficult goal; it’s been suggested that we should “stick to our knitting.” We feel that sticking to global health, when we see other causes as <i>potentially</i> more promising, would be out of line with our fundamental mission and value-added as an organization that seeks to help people do as much good as possible. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/objections-and-concerns-about-our-new-direction#Knitting\">More</a></li><li>Some are concerned specifically about <strong>new causes that don’t lend themselves to measurement and cost-effectiveness calculations</strong> (such as <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/meta-research\">meta-research</a>). It may be difficult to remain systematic and transparent about how we make decisions in these more speculative areas. We recognize this concern, but feel that we can remain systematic and transparent even where measurement is difficult or impossible; furthermore, we feel that we must find a way to do this if we are to have a strong case that philanthropy as a whole (not just sub-sectors of it) should be more systematic and transparent. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/objections-and-concerns-about-our-new-direction#Measurement\">More</a></li></ul><p>Despite the concerns and risks above, we feel that the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/objections-and-concerns-about-our-new-direction#Benefits\">benefits</a> of our new direction outweigh them. A major input into this view is the feeling that sticking to our old process would be extremely unlikely to result in finding more outstanding giving opportunities within a reasonable period of time; this is something we will be writing more about.</p><p>That said, <strong>we do recognize the concerns and risks, and we are interested in others’ thoughts on them.</strong></p><h1>The risk of losing our objectivity</h1><p>To date, all of GiveWell’s recommendations have involved unrestricted support to existing organizations. Because of this, we can be pointed to as a “neutral third party” that recommends organizations based exclusively on impact-related criteria. But we’re now contemplating doing what a lot of major funders do and helping to <i>set the agenda</i> for a funded organization, through the mechanism of restricted funding. If we did this, we might have difficulty being neutral between (a) projects that we help design and (b) charities that are simply asking for unrestricted funds, not contracting with us. In fact, we might be tempted to eschew (b) entirely and focus exclusively on designing - rather than finding - giving opportunities.</p><p>One important principle here is that <strong>we will draw a clear line between organizations we recommend for unrestricted funding and projects designed by GiveWell.</strong> We don’t know exactly how the visual presentation will work yet, but we have agreed on the principle that there will be a clear distinction - including on our higher-level and frequently-accessed pages - between GiveWell-designed projects and recommended charities.</p><p>Of course, there is still a risk that recommendations for unrestricted funding will have “soft conditions” (i.e., that it will be clear to charities what activities they have to carry out in order to earn or maintain recommendations); this is something that has always been true, though I think the situation is somewhat mitigated by the nature of the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability#HowGiveWellanalyzesroomformorefunding\">room for more funding analysis</a> we perform. (Our analysis asks for predicted charity activities based on <i>total unrestricted funding</i>, not based on <i>GiveWell-specific funding</i>. The expectation is that if GiveWell-directed funding falls short of expectations and the gap is made up by other funding, the activities will still be as outlined; this hopefully provides charities an incentive to project the activities they would most like to carry out, rather than projecting the activities they hope will most appeal to GiveWell specifically.)</p><p>Even with a clear distinction, there could still be a reasonable concern that GiveWell will over-allocate resources (in terms of investigative capacity) to designing its own projects, as opposed to finding great organizations. We recognize this concern, but wish to note that - philosophically - we <strong>greatly prefer unrestricted to restricted funding, and greatly prefer a “hands-off” to a “hands-on” approach.</strong> We don’t have the capacity to actively manage projects ourselves, and we believe projects are likely to work out better when they are run by people who fully buy into them (as opposed to people who are fulfilling the requirements of restricted funding).</p><p>It’s partly because of this philosophy that we’ve stayed away from restricted funding to date, and we remain highly cautious about it. We would prefer to stick to unrestricted funding and may never in fact deal in restricted funding.</p><p>Yet it is worth noting why we are considering restricted funding now in a way that we haven’t before. Our impression is that major funders frequently make extensive use of restricted funding; as a result, the existing landscape consists of many charities whose agendas are set partly or fully by external funders.</p><ul><li>We’ve been surprised by the disconnect we’ve observed in which there is a large number of <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs#Priorityprograms\">promising interventions</a> but few charities that focus on these interventions (in a way such that <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability#HowGiveWellanalyzesroomformorefunding\">additional dollars</a> will mean additional execution).</li><li>More generally, we’ve been surprised that in the majority of conversations in which we ask an organization what it would do with more unrestricted funding, it has no clear answer, and prefers instead to tailor its answer to our priorities.</li></ul><p>Practically speaking, charities have to focus on what they can fund; and in today’s world, it seems possible that agendas are largely set by funders. Our ideal role would be to “free” great organizations from restricted funding, allowing them to carry out promising projects that they can’t fund otherwise. However, it seems possible that there are too few charities for whom funding would make this sort of a difference, and there is thus some argument for our taking the sort of active role that other funders do.</p><p>Finally, by being open to restricted funding, we’ve come across some opportunities that are similar to “unrestricted funding” in most relevant ways, but that structurally involve restrictions and that we couldn’t have come across using our former approach. For example, we’re currently considering the idea of funding particular parts of UNICEF that work on particular interventions that we’re interested in. This wouldn’t involve laying out our own plan, and it would involve getting money to a specific team and leaving the use of the funds at their discretion; however, we could not find this sort of giving opportunity by talking to general UNICEF representatives and asking what they would do with more unrestricted funding. In some sense it may be appropriate to think of UNICEF (and other organizations like it) as a coalition of teams with their own priorities rather than as a single team with a single set of priorities; so in this case a gift that is formally restricted may have many of the desirable qualities of an unrestricted gift. To avoid confusion, we will still distinguish any recommendations along these lines from purely unrestricted gifts, as laid out above.</p><h1>The risk of spreading ourselves too thin</h1><p>We still have a lot to learn about <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/22/my-favorite-cause-for-individual-donors-global-health-and-nutrition/\">global health and nutrition</a> (as indicated by, among other things, <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/03/26/villagereach-update/\">our continued learning from VillageReach’s progress</a>). It has been suggested that we should “stick to our knitting,” focusing on the areas of giving in which (a) we’ve built up the brand we have; (b) data and feedback loops tend to be unusually good for the nonprofit world, facilitating learning.</p><p>In response, I’d observe:</p><ul><li>GiveWell is still a young organization. I believe we have attracted attention more for “bringing a different perspective and approach to giving” than for “being experts in global health” (the latter certainly does not describe us). We recognize that we’re taking some level of risk in moving into new areas, but we also believe that taking risks and staying open to new approaches is a major part of what makes GiveWell what it is and that part of “sticking to our knitting” is retaining this quality. We believe that GiveWell and the donors who use our research will be best served by our continuing to do whatever we believe will lead to the best giving opportunities, continuing to change course as much as necessary to facilitate this, and continuing to bring a different perspective and approach to giving - not continuing to focus on global health.</li><li>While we <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/22/my-favorite-cause-for-individual-donors-global-health-and-nutrition/\">currently believe that global health is the most promising cause given the information available</a>, we are not confident in this conclusion. We believe that <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewell-labs-update-and-priority-causes\">other causes are potentially promising as well</a>, and if we never investigate them, we will be failing in our mission of finding the best giving opportunities possible.</li><li>We are currently expanding our staff; we expect that we will invest at least as much time in global health over the next few years as over the last few (while also investing time in other causes).</li></ul><h1>The risk of losing transparency and systematicity as we move away from highly measurable interventions</h1><p>We have <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/22/my-favorite-cause-for-individual-donors-global-health-and-nutrition/\">written before</a> that the cause of “global health and nutrition” seems unusually well-suited to meaningful measurement and metrics (by the standards of the nonprofit sector). When working within this cause, we have been able to be relatively clear about our <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/process/2011\">process</a> and about what distinguishes a recommended from a non-recommended charity. There is some risk that as we tackle other causes, such as <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/meta-research\">meta-research</a>, we will have less of an evidence base to go off of; our goals will be further out; we will have to use more intuition and may therefore become less systematic and transparent.</p><p>We believe this is a real risk. However, we also believe that (a) the best opportunities for good giving don’t necessarily lie in the domains with the highest measurability (though there is something to be said for measurability, all else equal); (b) we have reached the point where we feel we can explore causes such as meta-research in a way that - while not as systematic as our work on global health - will still include a great deal of public discussion of how we’re thinking, why we recommend what we do, what the key assumptions are in our thinking and recommendations, and how our projects progress over time.</p><p>We have long advocated that philanthropists should be more systematic and transparent in their work. If our own systematicity and transparency applies only to the cause where measurement is easiest, we won’t have a very strong case; if, however, we can consistently bring an unusually level of systematicity and transparency to every cause we examine (even those that are less prone to measurement), we will have much more potential to change philanthropy broadly rather than just a single sector of it.</p><h1>The benefits of our new direction</h1><p>The above discussion addresses potential concerns over our new direction. We have <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/why-givewell-labs\">previously discussed the substantial benefits</a>: finding the best giving opportunities possible and reaching the largest donors possible, both of which are core to our mission. Dealing with the above issues - keeping a focus on recommending unrestricted funding when possible, covering new causes without overly detracting from continued progress on the causes we know well, and remaining systematic and transparent - will be a challenge, but we feel that it is well worth it, <strong>especially because we feel we are reaching the limits (for the moment) of our old approach</strong>. (We went through a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/process/2011\">large number of charities in 2011</a> and are skeptical that we will find new contenders for our <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>, using that basic methodology, anytime in the near future.)</p><p>We welcome further comments and criticisms regarding our new approach.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"toct8RYvTvgontEts":1,"ZCihBFp5P64JCvQY6":1,"uCPFdnpD6e4CCX8nC":1},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":2,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000062,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-12-22T14:44:38.117Z","name":"Open Philanthropy","slug":"open-philanthropy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> (previously the <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>) is a research and grantmaking foundation based in San Francisco.</p><h2 id=\"History\">History</h2><p>Open Philanthropy launched in late 2011, as a partnership between <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/good-ventures\">Good Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell\">GiveWell</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftgc02qi0fmg\"><sup><a href=\"#fntgc02qi0fmg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The partnership operated under the name <strong>GiveWell Labs</strong> before adopting, in August 2014, the name <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4vww1w7m4ep\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4vww1w7m4ep\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It continued to be part of GiveWell until 2017, when it became an independent organization.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh926zy6ps5f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh926zy6ps5f\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The name was changed to <strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> around December 2019.</p><h2 id=\"Leadership\">Leadership</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/cari-tuna\">Cari Tuna</a> is Open Philanthropy's president, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/holden-karnofsky\">Holden Karnofsky</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/alexander-berger\">Alexander Berger</a> are its two co-CEOs.

I suggested that one method was to work out what are potentially the biggest problems the world faces, work out what the crucial normative consideration are, and then work on those areas. Call that the top-down method: starting with the problem, and working backwards to the actions one should take.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a second method for high impact philosophy, however. Let&#x2019;s call it the bottom-up method.</p><p>Begin by asking &#x2018;which are the biggest decisions that one typically makes in life?&#x2019;\nThen ask: &#x2018;What are the crucial normative considerations that might affect how I should make those decisions?&#x2019;\nThen figure out which of these crucial considerations is most likely to produce an action-relevant outcome given your marginal research time.\nThen work on that topic!\nAs in my previous post, I&#x2019;ll go through each step in turn.</p><p>1) <b>What are the biggest decisions one typically makes in life?</b></p><p>By &#x2018;biggest decisions&#x2019; I mean the decisions that potentially have the greatest positive or negative moral impact. In general, these will be those decisions that involve the greatest amount of resources &#x2013; where having greater &#x2018;resources&#x2019; is just the power to make things happen.\nSo what are the biggest decisions one typically makes in life? The list would certainly include the following:</p><p>i. How should I spend my money?\nWhy?\nOver a lifetime, a high school graduate can expect to earn <a href=\"http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/moneymatters/a/edandearnings.htm\">$1.2million</a>. With a bachelor&#x2019;s degree, that figure almost doubles to $2.1 million; with a professional degree that number doubles again, to $4.4 million. Considered over a lifetime, almost every person reading this blog is a millionaire.</p><p>ii. What career should I choose?\nWhy?\nA typical lifetime career involves over 80,000 hours of work &#x2013; that&#x2019;s more time than we&#x2019;ll spend on any other activity, except sleeping.</p><p>2) <b>What are the crucial normative questions?</b></p><p>There are some questions that have analogues for both (i) and (ii). For instance:</p><p>Should I just spend my money/time wherever it has greatest current expected benefit? What are the conditions under which I should:</p><p>* Invest my money (e.g. in an index fund) or time (e.g. getting a degree) so that I generate a bigger payoff later?</p><p>* Use my money/time to fund/do research into how best to spend my money/time?</p><p>* Use my money/time to fund/do research into how best to invest my money/time?\nThere are also subtle concepts that are relevant to both. For example:</p><p>* Replaceability: Sometimes, if I don&#x2019;t work for an organisation, someone else will take my place.</p><p>* Similarly, sometimes, if I don&#x2019;t donate to a charity, then someone else will do so instead, and they&#x2019;ll fill their room for more funding anyway.</p><p>* Compensation: if we remove one doctor from the NHS, then all the other doctors in the NHS will compensate: they&#x2019;ll stop doing the least important tasks, and do the more important tasks that that one doctor would have done. So the benefit from a marginal (that is, one additional) doctor is far smaller than the average benefit from all doctors.</p><p>* Similarly, I should expect that charities do the most cost-effective interventions first, and so the benefit from a marginal dollar will be less than the average benefit from the charity&#x2019;s expenditure.\nAnd there are questions to do with the interaction between these two issues:</p><p>* How should I value my time, in monetary terms? Under what conditions should I turn time into money, and vice versa?\n3) <b>Which topics would be advanced the most from one&#x2019;s marginal research time?</b></p><p>Again, a good heuristic is to look at which topics are the least well-studied.\nThe question of &#x2018;giving now vs giving later&#x2019; has had only one academic article written about it: interestingly, people tend to find the idea that one should save and give later on, even though we&#x2019;re perfectly happy with the idea that one should invest time in oneself (e.g. by getting a degree) in order to have greater influence later on, and we&#x2019;re perfectly happy with the idea that, for self-interested reasons, one should save one&#x2019;s money now, in order to consume more later on.\nThe question of how much we should discount future time and money has been extensively discussed by economists; but not, to my knowledge, in the condition where one&#x2019;s principal aim is to benefit others (rather than oneself).\nI don&#x2019;t know of any in-depth philosophical discussions of replaceability or compensation effects.</p><p>So, though the top-down approach has had very little attention within philosophy, the bottom up approach, to my knowledge, has had basically none. This is remarkable, given the ubiquity and importance of the questions. One possible explanation is practical ethics&#x2019; obsession with developments in biomedical science; another might be that so many of the issues often blur with economics, so it&#x2019;s difficult for non-specialists to contribute. But, finally, it&#x2019;s worth considering that ethical scrutiny of career choice and our spending habits is radical, in terms of its potential impact on our lives, in a way that discussions of the wrongness of stealing or of cloning typically aren&apos;t. And it can be difficult to write on issues that can so greatly affect how one ought to spend one&#x2019;s time (especially when the conclusion might be that one should stop being a philosopher).</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"4CH9vsvzyk4mSKwyZ":2,"tmQ7kd3bFTnSQveDv":2},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":0,"extendedScore":null,"score":0,"pingbacks":{"Posts":["f384sGgrp74DWdGyj"]},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-24T16:38:12.387Z","name":"Career choice","slug":"career-choice","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Career choice</strong> is a crucial decision in the life of most individuals.

That&#x2019;s a shame. Not all problems that are discussed in ethics are equally important.

To a large extent, this has been because, until very recently, GWWC was run on an entirely voluntary basis.&#xA0; Now that we have full-time staff, we hope to be able to rectify these issues over time.</span></p>\n<span>As a first step, this blog post and the next will explain our methodology in a little more detail.</span>\n<h2><span>What metric?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The crucial question for any charity evaluator is: what metric to use? GWWC is solely focused on finding the most <em>cost-effective</em> charities: that is, the charities that have the highest ratio of good produced per dollar given to the charity. &#xA0;Along with <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, we are the only charity evaluators that are&#xA0;</span><span>solely concerned with cost-effectiveness so understood. (1)</span></p><p></p><p></p><h2><span>Explanation of what &#x2018;producing good&#x2019; consists of</span></h2>\n<em><span>Isn&#x2019;t the idea of &#x2018;good&#x2019; subjective?</span></em>\n<p><span>The grain of truth in that question is that different people&#x2019;s conceptions of the good vary.&#xA0; Some people think that scientific knowledge is of value in itself; other people think that scientific knowledge is only valuable insofar as it improves the lives of others.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the sum total of human wellbeing is a component of any plausible moral view, and, on most moral views, increasing human wellbeing is the main way to do good in the world.&#xA0; For these reasons, it&#x2019;s this aspect that we focus on. If this is not a component of your moral view, then our research will not be of use to you (but then, if you aren&#x2019;t concerned by increasing human wellbeing, it&#x2019;s unlikely that giving to global poverty alleviation is your top priority).&#xA0; In future posts, we&#x2019;ll explain how to measure increases in human wellbeing.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>What does &#x2018;producing&#x2019; good mean?</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Good question.&#xA0; A mistake to avoid is to think of producing good as to mean <em>causing</em> good.&#xA0; To illustrate, consider two charities that one could give to.&#xA0; Charity A will save 10 lives with every $10 000 given to it; Charity B will save 5 lives with every $10 000 given to it.&#xA0; However, if you don&#x2019;t give $10 000 to Charity A, it will fill up its room for more funding from other donors (who wouldn&#x2019;t have given at all otherwise).&#xA0; Whereas if you don&#x2019;t give the $10 000 to Charity B, it will not fill up its room for more funding from additional donors.&#xA0; In this case, you should donate to Charity B rather than Charity A: though you directly cause 10 lives to be saved by donating to Charity A, you don&#x2019;t really do any additional good, because those lives would have been saved anyway.&#xA0; In contrast, you do make a difference (of 5 lives saved) by donating to Charity B.</span></p>\n<p><span>Making this more precise: what producing good means is as follows.&#xA0; First, you consider two possibilities: (i) where you give $n to Charity X; (ii) where you burn the money.&#xA0; Now think: how good is the world in which (i) you give the money?&#xA0; And how good is the world (ii) in which you burn the money?&#xA0; The amount of good you produce by giving $n to charity X is the difference in the goodness of the world in which you do give, minus the goodness of the world in which you burn the money.(2)</span></p>\n<p><span>Importantly, the above method means that all consequences are considered.&#xA0; So &#x2018;good produced&#x2019; does not just mean &#x201C;impact provable in a few years&#x201D;; long-run consequences are just as relevant to cost-effectiveness as short-run consequences.&#xA0; Nor does &#x2018;good produced&#x2019; mean &#x2018;the effect on the direct beneficiaries of an action&#x2019;; effects on third parties are just as relevant as effects on direct beneficiaries.</span></p>\n<em><span>But surely you can never know what organisation does the most good per dollar?</span></em>\n<p><span>That&#x2019;s exactly right &#x2013; we&#x2019;ll never know what the best charity is.&#xA0; However, that doesn&#x2019;t prevent charity recommendations from being possible. It just means that we need to think in terms of expected good.&#xA0; To see this concept in action, consider two donation opportunities.&#xA0; Donating $10 000 to charity A will certainly save one life.&#xA0; Donating $10 000 to charity B will probably (80% likelihood) save two lives; but has some chance (20%) of producing no benefit. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>In general, to work out the expected value of an action X, you look at each possible outcome that could result from X; for each possible outcome, you multiply the probability of that outcome occurring by the goodness of that outcome, if it does occur; and you then take the sum of this product across all possible outcomes. &#xA0; So the expected value of donating $10 000 to charity A is 1 life x 100% = 1; whereas the expected value of donating $10 000 to charity B is 2 lives x 80% = 1.6.</span></p>\n<p><span>The concept of expected value becomes especially important in situations of great uncertainty, such as charity evaluation.&#xA0; Further posts will discuss in more detail how to correctly apply this concept.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h2><span>What evidence do you use?</span></h2>\n<p><span>In principle, we&#x2019;re open to evidence from any source, and if certain sources prove to be particularly reliable or unreliable, we will alter which sources we rely on.&#xA0; In the past, we&#x2019;ve used the latest peer-reviewed research from health and development economics, information from larger cost-effectiveness-focused academic projects such as the Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (2nd edition) and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, and on research from other charity evaluators, in particular from GiveWell.&#xA0; Like a growing number of organisations, we place particular weight on randomised controlled trials where they are available.</span></p>\nIn the near future we will also begin publishing draft reports on topics and passing them around in order to to solicit additional information from experts and the public.\n<p><span>Sometimes, we have to rely more on &#x2018;back-of-the-envelope&#x2019; calculations, and first-order research.&#xA0; This is especially true for some of the more conceptual, but potentially game-changing considerations.</span></p>\n<p><span>What do you plan to work on, going forward?</span></p>\n<span>We&#x2019;ll work on whatever we think will generate the most benefit with our additional research hours.&#xA0; This can include areas where:&#xA0;</span>\n<ol>\n\t<li><span>There has been little useful work done</span></li>\n\t<li><span>We think that there are large gains from small amounts of work</span></li>\n\t<li><span>We think there might be a game-changing or &#x2018;crucial&#x2019; considerations, that could increase the cost-effectiveness of one&#x2019;s donations by several times.</span><span>&#xA0;</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Where we think we have particular skills that are lacking elsewhere.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span>Particular questions we will address in the future include:</span><p></p><p><em><span>Should one give now, or invest and give later? &#xA0;</span></em>\n</p><p><span>This is an issue that satisfies (1), (3) and (4).&#xA0; It&#x2019;s potentially game-changing because it&#x2019;s at least plausible that one can have significantly greater impact with one&#x2019;s donations by investing one&#x2019;s money, and donating when we have better evidence regarding charity cost-effectiveness.</span></p>\n<em><span>Should one give to &#x2018;meta-charity&#x2019; such as charitable fundraising or cost-effectiveness research?</span></em>\n<p><span>This is an area that satisfies at least conditions (1)-(3).&#xA0; The average return on investment from charitable fundraising is 5:1 &#x2013; far higher than the typical market return on investment &#x2013; and the highest-return fundraising can significantly outstrip that.&#xA0; This suggests that &#x2018;investment&#x2019; in fundraising could be extremely cost-effective.</span></p>\n<p><span>As well as funding fundraising, one could fund additional research. The current state of knowledge regarding cost-effectiveness is poor, and, in general, where knowledge is poor, the value of gaining new information becomes very high.&#xA0; In the case of cost-effectiveness evaluation, it also has great potential to affect large future donation streams.</span></p>\n<em><span>What are the best sources of information out there to donors?</span></em>\n<p><span>This is an area that satisfies conditions (1) and (2).&#xA0; There is a proliferation of charity evaluators out there &#x2013; which should one trust, and why?</span></p>\n<em><span>What are the most promising cause-areas for further research?</span></em>\n<p><span>This is an area that satisfies (1) and (3); it&#x2019;s also an area that we feel it&#x2019;s important to explore in order to explain to givers why we focus on the areas that we do.&#xA0; Our primary question is: are there any cause areas that could plausibly contain interventions with expected cost-effectiveness considerably greater than developing world health?&#xA0; Examples of such cause areas include climate change, medical and other research, political lobbying and economic empowerment.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the near future, we don&#x2019;t plan to do further in-depth evaluation of developing world health charities, as we&#x2019;ve found GiveWell&#x2019;s research in this area to be of high quality, and we don&#x2019;t think that marginal research hours from us would provide much additional benefit. This kind of work does not appear to be our &#x2018;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage\">comparative advantage</a>&#x2019; in the charity effectiveness community.&#xA0; However, we will remain as an independent group in this area, and will check GiveWell&#x2019;s research before relying on it, as we would do with other sources of information.</span></p>\n<p>Many of these questions will be tackled in a new format for us - <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research#papers\">research papers</a>.</p>\n<p><span>A periodically updated list of possible research topics for new volunteers is&#xA0;</span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDGXZg3yN56l6YVTAJ1NEs67Uxee-YcpesSW5WSElLM/edit?pli=1\">available here</a><span>.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h2><span>Who&#x2019;s on the research team?</span></h2>\n<span>Below are some of the people involved in our research team.</span>\n<p><span><strong>Rob Wiblin (Staff)</strong>.&#xA0; As of late September, Rob has been our Director of Research.&#xA0; He graduated top of his year in Applied Economics from the Australia National University, and has worked as a research economist in several Australian Government agencies including the Productivity Commission.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Sally Murray (volunteer)</strong>.&#xA0; Sally is a graduate student in Development Studies (Research) at the London School of Economics.

The principal change was that they now have a third top-recommended charity, GiveDirectly, a charity that makes unconditional cash transfers to the very poor in Kenya. GiveWell gave GiveDirectly their #2 ranking &#x2014; above Schistosomiasis Control Initiative but below Against Malaria Foundation.</p><p><span>My initial reaction to this recommendation was surprise, and, after reading the material available on their website, I remain surprised that they have <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/11/26/our-top-charities-for-the-2012-giving-season/\">chosen to upgrade</a> GiveDirectly to the #2 slot. This post explains why.<!--break--> In a follow-on post, I&#x2019;ll take the opportunity to make some more general comments on things that I find lacking or am concerned about in GiveWell&#x2019;s research and recommendations. Before I begin, I&#x2019;ll note that their blog and website does repeatedly mention that more information will be released soon, so hopefully the issues below will be addressed there. I&#x2019;ll also note that GiveWell takes direct criticism from others as both helpful and a sign of respect, which is exactly how I intend what follows. Finally, I&#x2019;ll caveat that the views below are my own first reactions; they aren&#x2019;t meant to represent the views of GWWC as a whole.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><strong><span>Concerns about GiveWell&#x2019;s Recommendation</span></strong></p><p><span>GiveWell mention that cash transfers face an unusually low burden of proof. If that&#x2019;s a low burden of proof for doing <em>some </em>good, then I agree. I think that cash transfers would be a reasonable standard of comparison by which to judge other charities &#x2014; it would be an indictment on the charity if they were performing worse than cash transfers. </span></p><p><span>However, there are theoretical reasons why direct cash transfers should be less effective than the <em>best </em>intervention in the world. There are a number of ways in which we might be able to &#x2018;leverage&#x2019; our resources to achieve a surprisingly large impact, discussed below. Cash transfers do not exploit any of these.</span><strong><span>&#xA0;</span></strong></p><p><em><span>1. Positive Externalities</span></em></p><p><span>Let us suppose that those in extreme poverty are perfectly rational, with perfect information. Even if so, we should expect people &#x2014; anyone, but especially those whose basic needs are not met &#x2014; to use money in order to benefit themselves or their household rather than whatever would have the largest total benefit, including the effect on those around them. That certain goods have positive &#x2018;externalities&#x2019; is not a reason for individuals to purchase them, whereas it should be a reason for donors to purchase them. So by purchasing and providing goods with high positive externalities, the best charities should be able to outperform cash transfers.</span></p><p><span>Far from being a purely theoretical point, positive externalities actually seem to be key for the best interventions. The best health interventions increase productivity, which benefits the individual but also benefits those around them. In addition, preventing one person from catching a contagious disease prevents them from passing it on to others. Furthermore, parents may not be motivated to invest the socially optimal amount in their children&#x2019;s health and education. Not only does a lot of the benefit of this go to their children into the far future, but higher productivity will help other future citizens of the country. <a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/\">J-PAL</a> has found that income increases of the extremely poor are often spent making life more pleasant, such as by buying nicer-tasting food, rather than more, or more nutritious, food. This is discussed in an accessible way in the book <a href=\"http://www.pooreconomics.com/\">Poor Economics</a>.</span></p><p><span>GiveWell have data on how these cash transfers are spent: they could compare the positive externalities of tin roofs with healthcare. All of the points above have also a href=&quot;http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/30/giving-cash-versus-giving-bednets/&quot;&gt;been noted by GiveWell in one of their blog posts, which makes it surprising that this issue wasn&#x2019;t discussed in this release.</span></p><p><em><span>2. Economies of scale</span></em></p><p><span>The extremely poor can&#x2019;t currently buy albendazole (a deworming drug) for $0.50. Those living in rural areas simply can&#x2019;t access it without using considerably more than $0.50&#x2019;s worth of time travelling. In contrast, thanks to economies of scale, a mass deworming program <em>is</em> able to provide albendazole and other drugs for ~$0.50 per treatment. One could respond that the market would provide albendazole if it there was demand for it, but it&#x2019;s unclear whether that&#x2019;s true in the situations in which deworming charities operate. This is at least worth discussing.</span></p><p><span>Like the issue of externalities, this concern holds even if we assume the extremely poor to be &#x2018;perfect&#x2019; economic agents. But there are predictable ways in which they are not.</span></p><p><em><span>3. Lack of Information</span></em></p><p><span>An important way in which the extremely poor differ from idealised economic agents is lack of information. How much can we expect the extremely poor to know about the health benefits of consumption of albendazole? Or even the difference between long-lasting insecticide treated bednets and untreated bednets? For the world&#x2019;s poorest people, reliable health information can be too expensive, or simply impossible, to access. This creates a large industry of local practitioners with no medical training who dispense unhelpful or even dangerous advice. For those who would like to learn more, this problem is also discussed in Poor Economics.</span></p><p><span>Healthcare is often regarded as a case where markets fail because the &#x2018;information asymmetry&#x2019; between the consumer and supplier is so large. For this reason among others, government and non-profit providers play a much larger role in healthcare around the world than they do in most other markets. We should expect, and have plenty of empirical evidence suggesting, that the extremely poor are extremely poorly informed about medicines and healthcare. As a result, it is not foolish to hope that experts could do additional good by promoting or distributing medicines they wouldn&#x2019;t otherwise choose to buy.</span></p><p><em><span>4. Poor Rationality</span></em></p><p><span>This was the issue on which GiveWell focuses in their analysis, in their discussion of whether cash transfers increase alcohol and drug consumption. I personally would expect this to be a case where the poor behave closest to the standard economic model; with so little money, spending choices can be a matter of life-or-death, so the poor will likely think extensively about their purchases given the knowledge they have. </span></p><p><span>That said, the poor, like most of us, may <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/10/paternalism-can-be-kind-just-not-to-present-you.html\">discount future benefits more heavily</a> than we would like. This creates a kind of positive externality: as altruists we care about their future selves as much as their present selves, whereas they might care more about their present selves. There is some evidence, again discussed in Poor Economics, that the poor, under high stress and faced with constant temptation, struggle to save as much for the future as they would like.</span>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><span>I don&#x2019;t take the above theoretically driven concerns to demonstrate that GiveDirectly can&#x2019;t be one of the best charities out there. But they do make me initially skeptical. What surprised me is that GiveWell didn&#x2019;t address or even mention any other than the &#x2018;rationality&#x2019; concern. There was only a discussion of whether the additional cash is used to purchase alcohol or other drugs, or whether it has unintended side-effects like causing jealousy among neighbours.</span></p><p><span>In addition to the doubts raised above, I had some other concerns with GiveWell&#x2019;s methodology.</span></p><p><em><span>1. Lack of Evidence</span></em></p><p><span>My overall impression of GiveDirectly is that the evidence behind it is considerably more limited than either AMF or SCI. One salient instance of this is that, as far as I can tell, GiveWell rely on self-reported data in their assessment of where received cash is spent (where they suggest that 67% is spent on home improvement), in precisely a context where we would expect self-reporting to be misleading. Another is that, though there is extensive economic analysis of cash transfers, this has focussed on &#x201C;income transfers&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;wealth transfers&#x201D; (to use the distinction that <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">GiveDirectly make</a>), and we might see very different effects between the two.</span>&#xA0;</p><p><em><span>2. Lack of discussion of cost-effectiveness</span></em></p><p><span>One factor that I found very surprising is that there was no almost no discussion of how beneficial the marginal expenditure of cash transfer recipients actually is. How beneficial is it to have a metal roof rather than a bednet? What are the long-term benefits, and benefits to others, of metal roofs, as compared to bednets? This is something on which GiveWell has said more information will follow, so I won&#x2019;t dwell on it.

href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell\">GiveWell</a>, is as a benchmark for comparing the value of different causes and for deciding whether to fund certain charities.

Specifically, if a doubling of income confers roughly the same benefit to people regardless of income level—as life satisfaction surveys appear to suggest—, then the average citizen of a rich nation can expect to accomplish about 100 times as much by making a cash transfer to someone living in extreme poverty than by donating that money locally or keeping it to herself. This is because people in extreme poverty earn about 100 times less than people in rich countries on average do, so a donation that can double the comparatively rich person's income can double the income of about 100 extremely poor people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2yh747rj623\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2yh747rj623\">[3]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxs59w07p1rp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxs59w07p1rp\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Carter, Samantha (2019) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zrUAt1foKJE\">Are cash transfers the best policy option?</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Global</i>, October 20.</p><p>Devereux, Stephen (2002) <a href=\"https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/3907/Wp142.pdf\">Social protection for the poor: lessons from recent international experience</a>, working paper no. 142, Institute of Development Studies.</p><p>Evans, David K. &amp; Anna Popova (2017) <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1086/689575\">Cash transfers and temptation goods</a>, <i>Economic Development and Cultural Change</i>, vol. 65, pp. 189–221.</p><p>Fiszbein, Ariel &amp; Norbert Schady (2009) <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1596/978-0-8213-7352-1\"><i>Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty</i></a>, Washington, D.C.: The World Bank.</p><p>GiveWell (2012) <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers\">Cash transfers</a>, <i>GiveWell</i>, December (updated November 2018).</p><p>Molina Millán, Teresa <i>et al.</i> (2019) <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1093/wbro/lky005\">Long-term impacts of conditional cash transfers: review of the evidence</a>, <i>The World Bank Research Observer</i>, vol. 34, pp. 119–159.</p><p>Pega, Frank <i>et al.</i> (2017) <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2/related-content/podcast/51175/pt\">Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries</a>, <i>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</i>, issue 11, art. no.

In <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2003.html?countryName=World&amp;countryCode=xx&amp;regionCode=oc&amp;\">2011</a>, India&#x2019;s economy grew by 7.8%, whereas Namibia&#x2019;s economy grew by just 3.8%. In the long-run, insofar as your donation generates some jump in the productivity of the labour force, compounding effects will cause it to snowball into substantially more income if used in India than in Namibia. On this basis one might argue that donations to India constitute a better &#x2018;investment&#x2019; than donations to Namibia. On the other hand, one might reason that, because we should expect people to be richer in India in the future, they will get less benefit from any extra income in the future. The economic trajectory of the country that you try to help could potentially be a &#x2018;crucial consideration&#x2019; concerning which charity you should give to, but it hasn&#x2019;t yet been addressed by GiveWell.</p>\n\n<p>This is not even considering the magnitude and persistence of an intervention&#x2019;s impact on economic productivity. This is another crucial consideration which we understand GiveWell has looked into and found very difficult to answer.</p>\n\n<p><em>External Evaluation</em></p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, GiveWell haven&#x2019;t commissioned a thorough <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/self-evaluation\">external evaluation</a> of their recommendations. (GiveWell have done some external evaluations in the past, but mainly in 2010 or 2011, and mainly done by volunteer undergraduates or recent graduates.) This surprises me. Whereas businesses have a natural feedback mechanism, namely profit or loss, research often doesn&#x2019;t, hence the need for peer-review within academia. This concern, when it comes to charity-evaluation, is even greater. If GiveWell&#x2019;s analysis and recommendations had major flaws, or were systematically biased in some way, it would be challenging for outsiders to work this out without a thorough independent evaluation. Fortunately, GiveWell has the resources to, for example, employ two top development economists to each do an independent review of their recommendations and the supporting research. This would make their recommendations more robust at a reasonable cost.</p>\n\n<p><em>Billionaires and Room for More Funding</em></p>\n\n<p>To put it simply: If GiveWell&#x2019;s top recommended charities are so good, why hasn&#x2019;t their room for more funding been used up?</p>\n\n<p>GiveWell&#x2019;s view is that there are <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/06/11/why-we-should-expect-good-giving-to-be-hard/\">relatively few good giving opportunities</a>, because the best ones tend to be snapped up quite quickly. But they have provided very public information on their top-recommended causes, some of which have been on the list for years. And we know that major philanthropic foundations (such as the Gates Foundation, and CIFF) are aware of their research. So it&#x2019;s surprising, in their view, that the room for more funding for their top-recommended organisations wasn&#x2019;t used up rather more rapidly. This either suggests that their model of how philanthropy works is wrong, or that their recommendations aren&#x2019;t believed by the big players in the &#x2018;philanthropic market&#x2019;.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we accept that their model of an efficient market in philanthropy is inaccurate, and so could attribute the failure of big foundations to fund their recommended charities to irrationality or different values, there remains cause for concern. GiveWell functions in an advisory capacity to GoodVentures, which has very similar aims and attitudes to those of GiveWell. GoodVentures&#x2019; endowment could easily use up the room for more funding at GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities. So it raises the question why GoodVentures doesn&#x2019;t donate to GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities: even if not exhausting their room for more funding, at least using up a considerable proportion of it. The most plausible explanation in my mind is that GiveWell thinks that GoodVentures can better spend its money at a later date after further research. In which case, it&#x2019;s hard to see why individual donors shouldn&#x2019;t save and donate later, or even try to give to GoodVentures. Perhaps that&#x2019;s wrong, but it&#x2019;s worthy of discussion.</p>\n\n<p><em>What does GiveWell mean by &#x2018;good&#x2019;&#xA0;</em></p>\n\n<p>GiveWell claim that they want to maximise good done per dollar invested, but they haven&#x2019;t explained what they think &#x2018;good&#x2019; consists in and why. Do future people count? If so, how much, and how far into the future? Do they have a discount rate? How much priority should they give to the worst off? Is an infant death worse, or better, than the death of a 20 year old? How do they weigh improvements in health against extensions in health? What do they think is the relationship between economic growth and wellbeing?</p>\n\n<p>These are just of theoretical interest &#x2014; varying any of the parameters could lead to different charitable recommendations. For example, when they discuss AMF&#x2019;s cost-effectiveness, they focus on under-5 mortality. But they don&#x2019;t discuss the fact that most people think that an infant death is not as great a loss as a young adult death; an intuitive view that has good theoretical grounds. (This is something that will likely be taken into account in the next generation of the DALY metric, in the third edition of the Disease Control Priorities Project.) Depending on how, exactly, one thinks one should weigh saving infant lives against saving adult lives, this issue could make AMF several times less cost-effective relative to SCI than it is currently judged to be. This one methodological issue could therefore dramatically alter their recommendations.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>To their credit, GiveWell has moved towards helping people to tailor their choice to their values, by comparing the cost of bed nets delivered, children dewormed, and cash delivered. This can be done using spreadsheets and explanations provided in some recent <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/11/26/our-top-charities-for-the-2012-giving-season/\">blog</a> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/\">posts</a>. In its current form this requires more work than most donors would be willing to engage in. Making this easier, and guiding people through discovering the implications of their moral values would be worthwhile improvements. This kind of tailored advice is only possible for the minority of charities GiveWell has looked into in great detail, which means it is still important to be explicit about the value judgements that generated that shortlist.</p>\n\n<p>Once they allow the moral view or &#x2018;judgment calls&#x2019; of the donor to be an input, providing a #1 #2 #3 ranking of charities becomes misleading. For example, I wrote previously that I was surprised by their recommendation of GiveDirectly. Most of my surprise would have been alleviated if, rather than ranking them #2, they gave them a conditional recommendation: &#x201C;If you have such-and-such moral view, then GiveDirectly is an excellent option.&quot; Indeed, there are many reasonable views based on which giving to GiveDirectly could be the best option. Perhaps you do not want to be paternalistic towards the poor, even if being paternalistic would do more to improve their wellbeing in the long run. Or perhaps the reason you give is because you think you should redistribute your wealth as a matter of justice, and it&#x2019;s not your right to say how that money is spent. In either case, it&#x2019;s very useful to know that one has a good option to put wealth directly into the hands of the poor. But, if that&#x2019;s the motivation for recommending GiveDirectly, ranking them above SCI and below AMF disguises the fact that it is being judged on a different set of criteria.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"tE5BRNibhQogNJExQ":2},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":2,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000059,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-13T07:39:45.694Z","name":"Criticism of effective altruist organizations","slug":"criticism-of-effective-altruist-organizations","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>criticism of effective altruist organizations</strong> tag can apply to at least two kinds of posts:</p><ul><li>Posts criticizing the actions/strategy of a particular EA organization (or multiple orgs)</li><li>Posts written by EA orgs or their representatives, if users have written critical comments responding to those posts</li></ul><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruism\">criticism of effective altruism</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-causes\">criticism of effective altruist causes</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-the-effective-altruism-community\">criticism of the effective altruism community</a></p>","postCount":71,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"tE5BRNibhQogNJExQ"}]},{"_id":"5ykoKBcHBz6pXHLHu","postedAt":"2013-01-22T05:00:52.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Replaceability","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":null,"pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5ykoKBcHBz6pXHLHu/replaceability","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>Suppose I am trying to evaluate the consequences of taking job X.

I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if more sophisticated versions of this analysis are already well-understood amongst economists, and simply haven&#x2019;t been noticed by altruists trying to understand this issue. In that case, hopefully someone can point that out to me. Some of these analyses, and more sophisticated elaborations on them, appear in Ben Todd&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice\">masters thesis</a>.)<span></span><!--more--></p>\n<p><em></em><em>(Skip to section 6 if you want the punchline.)</em></p>\n<h2>1.</h2>\n<p>I should look at the direct consequences of doing job X, and choose a job for which those consequences are best.</p>\n<h2>2.</h2>\n<p>If I don&#x2019;t take job X someone else will. So I shouldn&#x2019;t be at all concerned with the immediate consequences of a job. Instead I should focus on the money I earn doing job X, which I will be able to spend at my own discretion (and which a substitute would have spent differently).</p>\n<h3>2b.</h3>\n<p>I should also reason about other parts of the job which I might do differently from my substitute; for example, if I intend to sabotage a company, my substitute probably won&#x2019;t. If I will do a better or worse job than my substitute, that will also be relevant, etc.</p>\n<h2>3.</h2>\n<p>But when I take job X I slightly increase the supply of people who are willing to do job X, slightly decrease the wages for job X, and therefore slightly increase the amount of that job X that gets done. So I should compare the elasticity of supply and demand in this market to determine what will happen to the total amount of job X that gets done. (I think this is a standard calculation in basic microeconomics.)</p>\n<h3>3b.</h3>\n<p>Markets aren&#x2019;t perfect spheres, and wages, demands, supplies, etc., will be slow and inconsistent in their reaction to an increase in supply. But if we look at the aggregate of many such decisions over a long period of time, this analysis should hold on average over many such decisions (and that should be good enough for our decision). Similarly, because workers commit to industries (for example by obtaining a degree in neuroscience) and industries commit to a number of workers (for example by investment in complementary capital) there is some necessary lag between an increased wage for job X and an increased supply. But over a long time period, on average, these effects seem to be neutral.</p>\n<h2>4.</h2>\n<p>In most industries the supply of labor is very elastic (because at equilibrium, if wages within an industry are lowered, people will instead take higher paying jobs elsewhere). Thus if I take job X, it will have little effect on the total amount of job X that gets done. So I should reason entirely about the money.</p>\n<h2>5.</h2>\n<p>But when I displace someone who would have done job X they take job Y, thus displacing someone else who goes on to take job Z. This process continues, each step having a small impact on wages, but the aggregate impact of many steps being unpredictable. To analyze the outcome we should appeal to a  simple equilibrium analysis: there is some supply of labor, and both before and after my introduction to the workforce, that supply of labor was being used roughly efficiently. So my impact is the same regardless of what job X is&#x2014;it is <i>as if</i> I were doing the most economically productive activity (on the margin).</p>\n<h3>5b.</h3>\n<p>Incentives aren&#x2019;t defined in terms of economic productivity. For example, there may be philanthropists or governments funding activity in a domain. Then we need to adjust the analysis to say: my impact is <i>as if</i> I were doing the activity which is most rewarded on the margin.</p>\n<h3>5c.</h3>\n<p>Different employees aren&#x2019;t perfect substitutes. I have my own set of skills, and the above analysis actually shows that I would be doing the most effective thing for a worker with my skills. So if I am a researcher, my impact will be to do the most  productive research.</p>\n<p>But of course it doesn&#x2019;t matter what my skills are, it matters what skills I am using&#x2014;the above analysis needs to be modified to take into account the fact that I might not pursue the most lucrative opportunity for someone with my skills. If I have a few different skills which don&#x2019;t often appear together, I can choose which of those skills to use (and therefore change my impact).</p>\n<p>However, if there are any laborers who were previously ambivalent between using those skills, then this effect will disappear. And if I can do either job X or job Y, in a large world it is very likely that others can as well. So I can actually have an impact only when everyone else faced with the choice between job X and job Y would definitely choose one or the other, i.e. when one of the jobs is less desirable than the other.</p>\n<h2>6.</h2>\n<p>But laborers differ in more ways than just their skills. The last consideration was actually a special case of the more general observation that laborers differ in terms of the <i>values</i> they have. In fact I am not alone in considering jobs based on more than just my anticipated compensation&#x2014;if I would choose job X over job Y because of altruistic considerations, there may be others who would do the same.</p>\n<p>What I am really doing when I decide to choose my job on the basis of altruistic concerns in addition to monetary compensation is changing the <i>aggregate demand</i> of laborers. In a world where all laborers made their decisions on the basis of only monetary compensation, the jobs that got done would be those that produced the most economic value. In a world where all laborers made their decisions on the basis of altruistic impact, the jobs that got done would be those that produced the most (direct) altruistic impact. In intermediate worlds, in which the labor force collectively makes its decisions on the basis of a combination of altruistic impact and economic value, the jobs that get done are those that are optimal according to that combination of values.</p>\n<p>Assuming that workers all value money enough that markets continue to function efficiently and facilitate (implicit) trade amongst people with different values, then my decision to base my job selection on a particular combination of money and other values serves to (slightly) change the collective values of the labor force, which in turn slightly changes which jobs get done.</p>\n<h3>6b.</h3>\n<p>If my values are sufficiently unusual that I am taking jobs which no one else would consider, then the above analysis breaks down&#x2014;unless individuals can engage in explicit trade with one another, in which case it seems to go through (modulo uncertainty about bargaining outcomes). This seems to be the role of money in the above picture.</p>\n<h2>Appendix:</h2>\n<p>An analogous situation seems to obtain with respect to spending money, charitable or otherwise (and in fact in a broader set of domains). If I choose to spend my money to accomplish project X, others may also stop spending money on project X. The proper way to understand my spending seems to be as a change to the <i>aggregate demands</i> of people with money. If I am spending money on things that are good for me, then I&#x2019;ve shifted the notion of &#x201C;economic value&#x201D; to include things that are good for me. If I spend more money, I shift it farther. If I spend money on things that are good for future generations, then I&#x2019;ve shifted the notion of &#x201C;economic value&#x201D; to include things that are good for future generations.</p>\n<p>So if we are comparing job-related impacts of a career with donation-related impacts, it seems like we should be reasoning about the importance of shifting &#x201C;what people are willing to work for&#x201D; vs. &#x201C;what people are willing to pay for.&#x201D; I hope that this kind of framework can lead to a less brittle picture than we currently have.</p>\n\n<p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"4CH9vsvzyk4mSKwyZ":1,"oyrF4wcA4H3t6gp8B":1},"voteCount":3,"baseScore":10,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000105,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-24T16:38:12.387Z","name":"Career choice","slug":"career-choice","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Career choice</strong> is a crucial decision in the life of most individuals.

Top undergraduates who want to &#x201C;make a difference&#x201D; are encouraged to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/education/23careers.html?_r=0\">forgo</a> the <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/wall-streets-latest-recruiting-crisis-on-campuses/\">allure</a> of Wall Street and work in the charity sector. And many people in finance have a mid-career <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-03/chelsea-clinton-exited-wall-street-to-seek-career-with-meaning\">ethical crisis</a> and switch to something <a href=\"http://mathbabe.org/2012/09/30/telling-people-to-leave-finance/\">fulfilling</a>.</p>\n<p>The intentions may be good, but is it really the best way to make a difference? I used to think so, but while researching ethical career choice, I concluded that it&#x2019;s in fact better to earn a lot of money and donate a good chunk of it to the most cost-effective charities&#x2014;a path that I call &#x201C;<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give\">earning to give</a>.&#x201D; Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and the others who have taken the 50% <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/\">Giving Pledge</a> are the best-known examples. But you don&#x2019;t have to be a billionaire. By making as much money as we can and donating to the best causes, we can each save hundreds of lives.</p>\n<p>There are three considerations behind this. First is the <a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\">discrepancy in earnings</a> between the different career paths. Annual salaries in banking or investment start at $80,000 and grow to over $500,000 if you do well. A lifetime salary of over $10 million is typical. Careers in nonprofits start at about $40,000, and don&#x2019;t typically exceed $100,000, even for executive directors. Over a lifetime, a typical salary is only about $2.5 million. By entering finance and donating 50% of your lifetime earnings, you could pay for two nonprofit workers in your place&#x2014;while still living on double what you would have if you&#x2019;d chosen that route.</p>\n<p>The second consideration is that &#x201C;making a difference&#x201D; requires <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice\">doing something that wouldn&#x2019;t have happened</a> anyway. Suppose you come across a woman who&#x2019;s had a heart attack. Luckily, someone trained in CPR is keeping her alive until the ambulance arrives. But you also know CPR. Should you push this other person&#xA0;out of the way and take over? The answer is obviously &#x201C;no.&#x201D; You wouldn&#x2019;t be a hero; you wouldn&#x2019;t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>So it goes in the charity sector. The competition for not-for-profit jobs is fierce, and if someone else takes the job instead of you, he or she likely won&#x2019;t be much worse at it than you would have been. So the difference you make by taking the job is only the difference between the good you would do, and the good that the other person would have done.</p>\n<p>The competition for finance jobs is even more fierce than for nonprofits, but if someone else gets the finance job instead of you, he or she would not likely donate as much to charity. The average donation from an American household is <a href=\"http://philanthropy.com/article/Interactive-How-America-Gives/133709/\">less than 5% of income</a>&#x2014;a proportion that decreases the richer the household. So if you are determined to give a large share of your earnings to charity, the difference you make by taking that job is much greater.</p>\n<p>The third and most important consideration is that charities vary tremendously in the amount of good they do with <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research/the-moral-imperative-towards-cost-effectiveness\">the money they receive</a>. For example, it <a href=\"http://www.guidedogsofamerica.org/1/mission/#cost\">costs about $40,000</a> to train and provide a guide dog for one person, but it costs less than $25 to cure one person of <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09286580590932761&#x2033;\">sight-destroying trachoma</a>. For the cost of improving the life of one person with blindness, you can cure 1,000 people of it.</p>\n<p>This matters because if you decide to work in the charity sector, you&#x2019;re rather limited. You can only change jobs so many times, and it&#x2019;s unlikely that you can work for only the very best charities. In contrast, if you earn to give, you can donate anywhere, preferably to the most cost-effective charities, and change your donations as often as you like.</p>\n<p>Not many people consider &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; as a career path. But it&#x2019;s proving popular. A good number of students that I&#x2019;ve presented this idea to have pursued it. One student, convinced by these arguments, now works at Jane Street, the trading firm, giving 50% of his income, and thus can already pay the wages of several people for the not-for-profit work he could have been doing.</p>\n<p>In general, the charitable sector is people-rich but money-poor.

They will bargain amongst each other and create a world that is good to live in.

I often have object level disagreements which seem to boil down to disagreement about which of these pictures is more important, but rarely do I see serious discussion of that question. (When there is discussion, it seems to turn into a contest of political ideologies rather than facts.)<span></span></p>\n<p>If we take picture (1) seriously, we may be interested in ensuring that society continues to function smoothly, that people are aware of and pursue what really makes them happy, that governments are effective, markets are efficient, externalities are successfully managed, etc. If we take picture (2) seriously, we are more likely to be concerned with changing what the people of the future value, bolstering the influence of people who share our values, and ensuring that altruists are equipped to embark on their projects successfully.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m mostly concerned with the very long run&#x2014;I am wondering what conditions will prevail for most of the people who live in the future, and I expect most of them to be alive very far from now.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that there are two major factors that control the relative importance of pictures (1) and (2): how prominent should we expect altruism to be in the future, and how efficiently are altruistic vs. selfish resources being used to create value? My answer to the second question is mostly vague hand-waving, but I think I have something interesting to say on the first question.</p>\n<h2><b>How much altruism do we expect?</b></h2>\n<p>I often hear people talking about the future, and the present for that matter, as if we are falling towards a Darwinian attractor of cutthroat competition and vanishing empathy (at least as a default presumption, which might be averted by an extraordinary effort). I think this picture is essentially mistaken, and my median expectation is that the future is much <i>more</i> altruistic than the present.</p>\n<h3><b>Dose natural selection select for self-interest?</b></h3>\n<p>In the world of today, it may seem that humans are essentially driven by self-interest, that this self-interest was a necessary product of evolution, that good deeds are principally pursued instrumentally in service of self-interest, and that altruism only exists at all because it is too hard for humans to maintain a believable sociopathic facade.</p>\n<p>If we take this situation and project it towards a future in which evolution has had more time to run its course, creating automations and organizations less and less constrained by folk morality, we may anticipate an outcome in which natural selection has stripped away all empathy in favor of self-interest and effective manipulation. Some may view this outcome as unfortunate but inevitable, others may view it as a catastrophe which we should work to avert, and still others might view it as a positive outcome in which individuals are free to bargain amongst themselves and create a world which serves their collective interest.</p>\n<p>But evolution itself does not actually seem to favor self-interest at all. <i>No matter what your values</i>, if you care about the future you are incentivized to survive, to acquire resources for yourself and your descendants, to defend yourself from predation, etc. etc. If I care about filling the universe with happy people and you care about filling the universe with copies of yourself, I&#x2019;m not going to set out by trying to make people happy while allowing you and your descendants to expand throughout the universe unchecked. Instead, I will pursue a similar strategy of resource acquisition (or coordinate with others to stop your expansion), to ensure that I maintain a reasonable share of the available resources which I can eventually spend to help shape a world I consider value. (See <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/09/spreading-happiness-to-stars-seems.html\">here</a> for a similar discussion.)</p>\n<p>This doesn&#x2019;t seem to match up with what we&#x2019;ve seen historically, so if I claim that it&#x2019;s relevant to the future I have some explaining to do.</p>\n<h3><b>Historical distortions</b></h3>\n<h4><i>Short-range consequentialism</i></h4>\n<p>One reason we haven&#x2019;t seen this phenomenon historically is that animals don&#x2019;t actually make decisions by backwards-chaining from a desired outcome. When animals (including humans) engage in goal-oriented behavior, it tends to be pretty local, without concern for consequences which are distant in time or space. To the extent that animal behavior is goal-oriented at a large scale, those goals are largely an emergent property of an interacting network of drives, heuristics, etc. So we should expect animals to have goals which lead them to multiply and acquire resources, even when those drives are pursued short-sightedly. And indeed, that&#x2019;s what we see. But it&#x2019;s not the fault of evolution alone&#x2014;it is a product of evolution <i>given</i> nature&#x2019;s inability to create consequentialist reasoners.</p>\n<p>Casually, we seem to observe a similar situation with respect to human organizations&#x2014;organizations which value expansion for its own sake (or one of its immediate consequences) are able to expand aggressively, while organizations which don&#x2019;t value expansion have a much harder time deciding to expand for instrumental reasons without compromising their values.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, this situation is exceptional in history. If humans ever manage to build systems which are properly consequentialist&#x2014;organizations or automations which are capable of expanding because it is <i>instrumentally</i> useful&#x2014;we should not expect natural selection to discriminate at all on the basis of those systems&#x2019; values.</p>\n<h4><i>Value drift</i></h4>\n<p>Human&#x2019;s values are also distorted by the process of reproduction. A perfect consequentialist would prefer to have descendants who share their values. (Even if I value diversity or freedom of choice, I would like my children to at least share those values, at least if I want that freedom and diversity to last more than one generation!) But humans don&#x2019;t have this option&#x2014;the only way we can expand our influence is by creating very lossy copies. And so each generation is populated by a fresh batch of humans with a fresh set of values, and the values of our ancestors only have an extremely indirect effect on the world of today.</p>\n<p>Again, a similar problem afflicts human organizations. If I create a foundation that I would like to persist for generations, the only way it can expand its influence is by hiring new staff. And since those staff have a strong influence over what my foundation will do, the implicit values of my foundation will slowly but surely be pulled back to the values of the pool of human employees that I have to draw from.</p>\n<p>These constraints distort evolution, causing selection to act only those traits which can be reliably passed on from one generation to the next. In particular, this exacerbates the problem from the preceding section&#x2014;even to the extent that humans <i>can</i> engage in goal-oriented reasoning and expand their own influence instrumentally, these tendencies can not be very well encoded in genes or passed on to the next generation in other ways. This is perhaps the most fundamental change which would result from the development of machine intelligences. If it were possible to directly control the characteristics and values of the next generation, evolution would be able to act on those characteristics and values directly.</p>\n<h3><b>So what <i>does</i> natural selection select for?</b></h3>\n<p>If the next generation is created by the current generation, guided by the current generation&#x2019;s values, then the properties of the next generation will be disproportionately affected by those who care most strongly about the future.</p>\n<p>In finance: if investors have different time preferences, those who are more patient will make higher returns and eventually accumulate much wealth. In demographics: if some people care more about the future, they may have more kids as a way to influence it, and therefore be overrepresented in future generations. In government: if some people care about what government looks like in 100 years, they will use their political influence to shape what the government looks like in 100 years rather than trying to win victories today.</p>\n<p>What natural selection selects for is patience. In a thousand years, given efficient natural selection, the most influential people will be those who today cared what happens in a thousand years. Preferences about what happens to <i>me</i> (at least for a narrow conception of personal identity) will eventually die off, dominated by preferences about what society looks like on the longest timescales.</p>\n<p>I think this picture is reasonably robust. There are ways that natural selection (/ efficient markets) can be frustrated, and I would not be <i>too</i> surprised if these frustrations persisted indefinitely, but nevertheless this dynamic seems like one of the most solid features of an uncertain future.</p>\n<h3><b>What values are we starting with?</b></h3>\n<p>Most of people&#x2019;s preferences today seem to concern what happens to them in the near term. If we take the above picture seriously, these values will eventually have little influence over society. Then the question becomes: if we focus only on humanity&#x2019;s collective preferences <i>over the long term</i>, what do those preferences look like? (Trying to characterize preferences as &#x201C;altruistic&#x201D; or not no longer seems useful as we zoom in.)</p>\n<p>This is an empirical question, which I am not very well-equipped to value. But I can make a few observations that ring true to me (though my data is mostly drawn from academics and intellectuals, who may fail to be representative of normal people in important ways even after conditioning on the &#x201C;forward-looking&#x201D; part of people&#x2019;s values):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When people think about the far future (and thus when they articulate their preferences for the far future) they seem to engage a different mode of reasoning, more strongly optimized to produce socially praise-worthy (and thus prosocial) judgments. This might be characterized as a <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/02/beware-far-values.html\">bias</a>, but to the extent we can talk about human preferences at all they seem to be a result of these kinds of processes (and to the extent that I am using my own altruistic values to judge futures, they are produced by a similar process). This effect seems to persist even when we are not directly accountable for our actions.</li>\n<li>People mostly endorse their own enlightened preferences, and look discouragingly at attempts to lock-in hastily considered values (though they often seem to have overconfident views about what their enlightened preferences will look like, which admittedly might interfere with their attempts at reflection).</li>\n<li>I find myself sympathetic to very many people&#x2019;s accounts of their own preferences about the future, even where those accounts different significantly from my own. I would be surprised if the distribution of moral preferences was too scattered.</li>\n<li>To the extent that people care especially about their species, their nation, their family, themselves, etc. : they seem to be sensitive to fairness considerations (and rarely wish e.g. to spend a significant fraction of civilization&#x2019;s resources on themselves), their preferences seem to be only a modest distortion of aggregative values (wanting people with property X to flourish is not so different from wanting people to flourish, if property X is some random characteristic without moral significance), and human preferences seem to somewhat reliably drift in the direction of more universal concern as basic needs are addressed and more considerations are considered.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After cutting away all near-term interests, I expect that contemporary human society&#x2019;s collective preferences are similar to their stated moral preferences, with significant disagreement on many moral judgments. However, I expect that these values support reflection, that upon reflection the distribution of values is not too broad, and that for the most part these values are reasonably well-aligned. With successful bargaining, I expect a mixture of humanity&#x2019;s long-term interests to be only modestly (perhaps a factor of 10, probably not a factor of 1000) worse than my own values (as judged by my own values).</p>\n<p>Moreover, I have strong intuitions to emphasize those parts of my values which are <em>least</em> historically contingent. (I accept that all of my values are contingent, but am happier to accept those values that are contingent on my biological identity than those that are contingent on my experiences as a child, and happier to accept those that are contingent on my experiences as a child than those that are contingent on my current blood sugar.) And I have strong reciprocity intuitions that exacerbate this effect and lead me to be more supportive of my peers&#x2019; values. These effects make me more optimistic about a world determined by humanity&#x2019;s aggregate preferences than I otherwise would be.</p>\n<h2><b>How important is altruism?</b></h2>\n<p>(The answer to this question, unlike the first one, depends on your values: how important to what? I will answer from my own perspective. I have roughly aggregative values, and think that the goodness of a world with twice as many happy people is twice as high.)</p>\n<p>Even if we know a society&#x2019;s collective preferences, it is not obvious what their relative <i>importance</i> is. At what level of prevalence would the contributions of explicit altruism become the source of value? If altruists are 10% of the influence-weighted population, do the contributions of the altruists matter? What if altruists are 1% of the population? A priori, it seems clear that the explicit altruists should do <i>at least</i> as much good&#x2013;on the altruistic account&#x2013;as any other population (otherwise they could decide to jump ship and become objectivists, or whatever). But beyond that, it isn&#x2019;t clear that altruists should create <i>much</i> more value&#x2013;even on the altruistic account&#x2013;than people with other values.</p>\n<p>I suspect that explicit altruistic preferences create many times more value than self-interest or other nearly orthogonal preferences. So in addition to expecting a future in which altruistic preferences play a very large role, I think that altruistic preferences would be responsible for most of the value even if they controlled only 1% of the resources.</p>\n<p>One significant issue is population growth. Self-interest may lead people to create a world which is good for themselves, but it is unlikely to inspire people to create as many new people as they could, or use resources efficiently to support future generations. But it seems to me that the existence of large populations is a huge source of value. A barren universe is not a happy universe.</p>\n<p>A second issue is that population <i>characteristics</i> may also be an important factor in the goodness of the world, and self-interest is unlikely to lead people to ensure that each new generation has the sorts of characteristics which would cause them to lead happy lives. It may happen by good fortune that the future is full of people who are well-positioned to live rich lives, but I don&#x2019;t see any particular reason this would happen. Instead, we might have a future &#x201C;population&#x201D; in which almost all resources support automation that doesn&#x2019;t experience anything, or a world full of minds which crave survival but experience no joy, or etc.; &#x201C;self-interest&#x201D; wouldn&#x2019;t lead any of these populations to change themselves to experience more happiness. It&#x2019;s not clear why we would avoid these outcomes except by a law of nature that said that productive people were happy people (which seems implausible to me) or by coordinating to avoid these outcomes.</p>\n<p>(If you have different values, such that there <em>is</em> a law [or at least guideline] of nature: &#x201C;productive people are morally valuable people,&#x201D; then this analysis may not apply to you. I know several such people, but I have a hard time sympathizing with their ethics.)</p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>I think that the goodness of a world is mostly driven by the amount of explicit optimization that is going on to try and make the world good (this is all relative to my values, though a similar analysis seems to carry with respect to other aggregative values). This seems to be true even if relatively little optimization is going on. Fortunately, I also think that the future will be characterized by <i>much</i> higher influence for altruistic values. If I thought altruism was unlikely to win out, I would be concerned with changing that. As it is, I am instead more concerned with ensuring that the future proceeds without disruptions. (Though I still think it is worth it to try and increase the prevalence of altruism faster, most of all because this seems like a good approach to minimizing the probability of undesired disruptions.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"t2L2RziMDLEuHBWNF":2,"FdbA8vts5JPKCEou8":2},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000079,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:27:27.708Z","name":"Longtermism","slug":"longtermism","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Longtermism</strong> is the view that positively influencing the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/long-term-future\">long-term future</a> is a key moral priority of our time.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2iwddw4crwt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2iwddw4crwt\">[1]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz6yx5b2rpim\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz6yx5b2rpim\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Longtermism may be seen as following from the conjunction of three key claims.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6frik8lwexe\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6frik8lwexe\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;First, future people matter morally.

This form of longtermism was introduced by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/hilary-greaves\">Hilary Greaves</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/william-macaskill\">Will MacAskill</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4lqrm1tu6v4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4lqrm1tu6v4\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and has precedents in the work of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/nick-bostrom\">Nick Bostrom</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefijdcuqtcsja\"><sup><a href=\"#fnijdcuqtcsja\">[5]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrxubxlbto4l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrxubxlbto4l\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/nick-beckstead\">Nick Beckstead</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefohggtozamwg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnohggtozamwg\">[7]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1j6xqn8ih7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1j6xqn8ih7f\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and others. Note that the authors do not define or discuss \"weak\" longtermism; the contrast is rather with longtermism as such, which as noted above holds that positively influencing the long-term future is a key priority, but not necessarily the top priority.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"Patient_vs__urgent_longtermism\">Patient vs. urgent longtermism</h3><p>This distinction can be explained in reference to the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/hinge-of-history\">hinge of history hypothesis</a>, i.e. the hypothesis that we are currently living at a time where humanity has unusually high influence over the long-term future. Urgent longtermists find the hypothesis plausible and, accordingly, hold that it makes sense to spend our altruistic resources relatively quickly. (Altruistic resources include not just financial assets, but other resources that can accumulate and be spent deliberately in the pursuit of altruistic goals, such as credibility, career capital and coordination ability.) By contrast, patient longtermists hold that the opportunities for influence are not concentrated in the near term and, in line with this, they favour investing these resources so that they can be deployed at some point in the future, when the moments of significant influence arrive.</p><h3 id=\"Broad_vs__targeted_longtermism\">Broad vs. targeted longtermism</h3><p>This distinction was originally introduced by Nick Beckstead in his doctoral dissertation, <i>On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref73581e7p8q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn73581e7p8q\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Targeted (or narrow) longtermism attempts to positively influence the long-term future by focusing on specific, identifiable scenarios, such as the risks of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-risk\">misaligned AI</a> or an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/biosecurity\">engineered pandemic</a>. By contrast, broad longtermism tries to have a long-term influence by pursuing general approaches with the potential to be useful in a broader range of contexts, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/building-effective-altruism-1\">building effective altruism</a> or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-cooperation\">promoting global cooperation</a>.</p><p>Both patient and urgent longtermism, and broad and targeted longtermism, are positions that exist on a continuum. The terms \"urgent\"/\"patient\" and \"broad\"/\"targeted\" divide these continua into two discrete regions, similarly to how the terms \"tall\" and \"short\" divide the height continuum. These distinctions may thus be seen as uncovering an underlying dimension along which longtermism can vary. Accordingly, the more relevant questions are \"How patient/urgent should longtermism be?\" or \"How broad/targeted should longtermist interventions be?\", rather than \"Should longtermism be patient or urgent?\" or \"Should longtermism be targeted or narrow?\"</p><h3 id=\"Other_distinctions\">Other distinctions</h3><p>One additional distinction sometimes made—which also originates in Greaves and MacAskill—is between <i>axiological</i> and <i>deontic</i> longtermism. (\"Axiological\" and \"deontic\" are technical terms borrowed from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-philosophy\">moral philosophy</a>: \"axiological\" means \"related to what is good or valuable\" and \"deontic\" means \"related to what we ought to do or have reason to do\".) Axiological longtermism holds that positively influencing the long-term future is among the most valuable things we can do, whereas deontic longtermism holds that positively influencing the long-term future is among the things we have most reason to do. Sometimes these views are combined with strong longtermism, so axiological strong longtermism becomes the view that influencing the long-term future is the most valuable thing to do and deontic strong longtermism becomes the view that influencing the long-term future is the thing we have most reason to do.</p><p>Another relevant distinction, introduced by the philosophers Johan Gustafsson and Petra Kosonen, is between <i>normative</i> and <i>prudential</i> longtermism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9uksbqguhw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9uksbqguhw\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Normative longtermism is longtermism as it is normally understood, i.e. as a view about what is valuable, or we have reason to do, from an impersonal or moral perspective. However, one can also consider a form of longtermism focused on what is in a person's self-interest. If humans could live for thousands or millions of years, it could be argued that, even from a self-interested perspective, each person should focus primarily on the long-term effects of their actions, because a person's lifetime wellbeing will be largely determined by those effects.</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Balfour, Dylan (2021) <a href=\"https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2021/09/17/longtermism/\"><u>Longtermism: how much should we care about the far future?</u></a>, <i>1000-Word Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology</i>, September 17.</p><p>Beckstead, Nick (2019) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198841364.003.0006\">A brief argument for the overwhelming importance of shaping the far future</a>, in Hilary Greaves &amp; Theron Pummer (eds.) <i>Effective Altruism: Philosophical Issues</i>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 80–98.</p><p>MacAskill, William, Hilary Greaves &amp; Elliott Thornley (2021) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-9957281-8-9\">The moral case for long-term thinking</a>, in Natalie Cargill &amp; Tyler John (eds.) <i>The Long View: Essays on Policy, Philanthropy, and the Long-Term Future</i>, London: First, pp. 19–28.</p><p>Moorhouse, Fin (2021) <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism/\">Introduction to longtermism</a>, <i>Effective Altruism</i>, January 27.</p><p>Roser, Max (2022) <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/longtermism\"><u>The future is vast: longtermism’s perspective on humanity’s past, present, and future</u></a>, <i>Our World in Data</i>, March 15.</p><p>Todd, Benjamin (2017) <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/\"><u>Longtermism: the moral significance of future generations</u></a>, <i>80,000 Hours</i>, October.</p><p>Wikipedia (2021) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Longtermism&amp;oldid=1090541975\"><u>Longtermism</u></a>, <i>Wikipedia</i>, October 28 (updated 30 May 2022‎).</p><h2 id=\"External_links\">External links</h2><p><a href=\"https://longtermism.com/\">Longtermism</a>.

I face the question: how much risk should I be willing to bear? Should I pursue safe investments, or riskier investments with higher returns?</p><p>My knee-jerk response is to say &#x201C;An altruist should be risk neutral. If you have twice as much money, you can do twice as much good. Sure, there are some diminishing returns, but my own investment is <i>minuscule</i> compared to an entire world full of philanthropists. So in the regime where I am investing, returns are roughly linear.&#x201D; (I might revise this picture if I thought that I was a very unusual philanthropist, and that few others would invest in the same charitable causes as me&#x2014;in that case I alone might represent a significant fraction of charitable investment in my causes of choice, so I should expect to personally run into diminishing returns.)</p><p>But on closer inspection there is something fishy about this reasoning. I don&#x2019;t have great data on the responsiveness of charitable giving to market performance, but at the individual level it <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3083340\">seems</a> that the elasticity of charitable giving to income is about 1&#x2014;if I am 50% richer (in one possible world than another), I tend to give 50% more to charity. So in worlds where markets do well, we should expect charities to have more money. If markets (rather, the average investor) do 10% better, I should expect 10% more money to be available for any particular charitable cause, regardless of how many donors it has.<span></span></p><p>Of course, there is a difference between the market&#x2019;s performance and my portfolio&#x2019;s performance&#x2014;the funds available to a charity depend little on how <i>my</i> portfolio does, just how the <i>average</i> donor&#x2019;s portfolio does. So what is the relevance of the above result to my own risk aversion? Intuitively it seems that the performance of the market is correlated with the performance of any particular investor, but how tightly?</p><p>There is a simple observation / folk theorem that applies to this situation. Suppose two investors&#x2019; portfolios are not perfectly correlated. Then (supposing those investors are earning the same returns) each would prefer to trade 1/2 of their portfolio for 1/2 of the others&#x2014;averaging two imperfectly correlated assets reduces the variance. In an efficient economy, this dynamic ensures that every investor&#x2019;s risk is well-correlated with the market. Any countercyclical assets will be absorbed into this ur-portfolio and invested in by every investor, thereby having the effect of reducing the variance of market returns.</p><p>There are many loopholes in this result, and markets are not perfectly efficient, but it provides an important intuition. If we have risky assets that are uncorrelated with (but have comparable returns to) the market, they will just be used to diversify portfolios and thereby become part of &#x201C;the market.&#x201D;</p><p>So to first order, the fact that I am a small piece of the charitable donations to a cause shouldn&#x2019;t matter. My risk is well-correlated with the risk of other investors, and if I lose 10% of my money in a year, other investors will also lose 10% of their money, and less money will be available for charitable giving. This holds regardless of whether a cause has a million donors or just one.</p><p>The original question: &#x201C;how risk averse should I be?&#x201D; is now a question about the returns to charitable activities at a large scale. Clearly the first charitable donations will go to the best causes. How quickly does the quality of marginal charitable giving decline, as total charitable giving increases? This question is fundamentally specific to a cause. For most causes, there seem to be substantial diminishing returns. Some diseases are much easier to treat than others, some disasters easier to mitigate, etc. etc. However, it is worth keeping in mind the distinction between diminishing returns to money in the long-run and in the short-run. For example, if you have only thought of one good thing to do with $1M, your second million dollars would not do nearly as much good if you had to spend it immediately. But this isn&#x2019;t because the second million dollars is much less valuable than the first million in the long run, it&#x2019;s because the second million would be complementary with thinking that you haven&#x2019;t yet done. In the long run you can spend more time thinking about what to do with $2M now that you have it, and put it to a good use. It still won&#x2019;t be as good as the first million, but not as much less valuable as it appears in the short run.</p><p>The following are some important caveats and postscripts to this basic picture.\n</p><h3><b>Ordinary investors are <i>very</i> risk averse</b></h3>\nI originally suspected that altruists should be risk-neutral because they are contributing only a small part to large projects, and therefore face roughly linear returns. By now I&#x2019;ve explicitly rejected that reasoning, but there is another reason that altruists might be interested in risky investments: ordinary investors appear to be <i>extremely</i> risk averse. Evidence of and explanations for the so-called equity premium puzzle are a bit tricky to untangle, but it <a href=\"http://www.commonfund.org/ei/2012%20EI%20Level%20I%20Prereading%20Material/Required%20Readings%20for%20Day%201%20-%20Monday,%20July%209th/Session%203%20-%20Long%20Term%20Global%20Equity%20Returns%20and%20the%20Equity%20Risk%20Premium/Rethinking%20the%20Equity%20Risk%20Premium%202011%20-%20CHAPTER%204.pdf\">looks like</a> there is a <i>big</i> premium on risk, such that risky equities earn annual returns a solid 3% higher than risk-free bonds.<p></p><p>If you have logarithmic utility, and estimate risk using historical data on the variability of equities returns, equities are a slam-dunk over safer investments, with risk-adjusted returns that are nearly twice as good. (This observation is the basis for the equity premium puzzle. The paper I linked suggests that the equity premium is smaller than you might naively estimate from US data, but it is still big enough to constitute a puzzle.) I think logarithmic returns are fairly conservative for altruistic projects (though perhaps not individuals&#x2019; consumption), and that for most causes the payoffs are much more risk-neutral than that. So it looks like altruists ought to go for risky investments after all.</p><p>Moreover, I suspect (on priors) that altruists tend to invest as cautiously as other investors, and so it makes little sense for an altruistic investor to diversify their portfolio between equities and bonds even if there is a significant risk of collapse in equities (other altruists are doing the diversification for them).\n</p><h3><b>Some risks are uncorrelated with the market</b></h3>\nThere are some opportunities which are risky but imperfectly correlated with the market (and sometimes nearly independent). For example, if you start or invest in a small company, your payoff will depend on that company&#x2019;s performance (which is typically quite risky but only weakly correlated with the market). In an idealized market this risk would be added to a larger portfolio of risks, but this often impossible due to moral hazard: if you received a paycheck that was independent of the success of your company, you would not be incentivized to run the company well, or to pick good companies to create or invest in. So no one is willing to sell you insurance in case your startup fails or your investment goes bad. The fact that you have to assume a big dose of risk is an unfortunate side-effect of this incentive scheme (and in a more efficient market we would expect angel investors and start-up founders to purchase more extensive insurance for various contingencies that would scuttle their enterprises but are clearly beyond their control).<p></p><p>To a normal person this risk is terrible, but to an altruist it should be considered a good opportunity (since other entrepreneurs and investors will tend to underprice such opportunities). See a discussion of this <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers\">here</a>, with some quantitative discussion.</p><p>This special case is only possible because the entrepreneur or investor is putting in their own effort, and moral hazard makes it hard to smooth out all of the risk across a larger pool (though VC funds will invest in many startups). You shouldn&#x2019;t expect to find a similar situation in investments, except when you are providing insight which you trust but the rest of the market does not (thereby preventing you from insuring against your risk).\n</p><h3><b>Prioritizing possible worlds and concentrating investments</b></h3>\nRisk-aversion is a special case of a more general phenomenon; a dollar is worth a different amount in different possible worlds. For normal risk-aversion, the issue is how much money <i>you</i> have in different possible worlds. A dollar is worth the most in the worlds where you are poorest. For altruists, the issue is how much money <i>charities</i> have in different possible worlds. A dollar is worth the most in the worlds where the least money is given to charities, and the largest number of attractive interventions go unfunded.<p></p><p>But there are other reasons that money may be more valuable in one possible world than another, which depend on which cause you actually want to support. Money aimed at helping the poor is most valuable in worlds where the developing world is not prospering. Vegan outreach is most useful in worlds where the meat industry is doing well, but vegetarian-friendly memes are prospering. Catastrophic risk mitigation is most valuable in troubled times. And so on. Each of these comparisons suggests an investment strategy; investors who care about cause X would prefer have money in worlds where it can be used to further cause X most efficiently.</p><p>Moreover, while ordinary risk averse investors are incentivized to construct a diversified portfolios, altruists have no such incentives. Though they should be concerned with risk, what they are really concerned with is the correlation between their risk and market returns. Thus they are not particularly interested in building a diversified portfolio, and it is particularly cheap for them to concentrate their investment in opportunities which will payoff in the worlds where they can best use money. Of course, this strategy becomes less attractive when very few people are interested in cause X, or when many of the investors interested in cause X are pursuing the same strategy&#x2014;those investors care about the correlation of their investment returns with each other, and <em>collectively</em> they do want to diversify their investments. If everyone who cares about vegetarianism goes broke in worlds where McDonald&#x2019;s folds, it is no longer the case that vegetarian dollars are less valuable in those worlds.\n</p><h3><b>Investing for the long haul</b></h3>\nI <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/02/22/four-flavors-of-time-discounting-i-endorse-and-one-i-do-not/\">think</a> that altruists concerned about the far future should consider investing and earning market returns for as long as possible, before leveraging a much-increased share of the future economy to further their own interests. How does risk relate to this plan?<p></p><p>It seems most productive to think about the <i>fraction</i> of world wealth which an investor controls, since this quantity should be expected to remain fairly constant regardless of what happens economically (though will hopefully drift upwards as long as the altruist is more patient than the average investor) and ultimately controls how much influence that investor wields. A simple argument suggests that an investor concerned with maximizing their influence ought to maximize the <i>expected</i> fraction of world wealth they control. This means that the value of an extra dollar of investment returns should vary inversely with the total wealth of the world. This means that the investor should act as if they were maximizing the expected <i>log</i>-wealth of the world.</p><p>The recommendations for this setting (investing for the long haul) are therefore nearly identical to the earlier setting (investing to give). As in the earlier case, the apparent arguments for maximizing expected returns are faulty because it is bad to be correlated with the market. But nevertheless, the equity premium is large enough that investing in risky assets is still worth it. In fact in this case the issue is even more clear-cut, since there is little uncertainty about how risk-averse we should be when investing for the long haul.\n</p><h3><b>The Kelly Criterion</b></h3>\nThe Kelly criterion is a simple guideline for gambling / investing. The motivating observation is that, to maximize expected long-run returns, it is best to use a logarithmic utility function (because the total return after N periods is the geometric, rather than arithmetic, return during those periods). If we are directly concerned with logarithmic utility, we don&#x2019;t need to rely on this argument and should just use the Kelly criterion immediately.<p></p><p>The Kelly criterion recommends splitting your money according to the probability of a payout, rather than concentrating all of your money on the single best bet. (See also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_matching\">probability matching</a>, which has been <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/origin.pdf\">justified</a> on similar grounds.) In the case of investments, this corresponds to the following strategy (if we assume you have a negligible &#x201C;edge,&#x201D; or ability to predict tomorrow&#x2019;s market prices better than other investors). For each asset, estimate what fraction of the current world&#x2019;s <i>actual</i> wealth is stored in that asset, and invest that fraction of your bankroll in that asset. As prices change, reallocate your money to maintain the same distribution. (If the value of land doubles while the rest of the economy stagnates, such that you now have twice as large a fraction of your bankroll invest in land, then sell off half of your land). Of course, if other investors are following a similar rule, any price changes will be information about the long-run values of the underlying asset values, but this seems to be <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/06/dreamtime-finance.html\">far from true</a> in the real world.</p><p>Investors who support a rare cause and care about diversifying their own portfolio, should probably pursue something like a Kelly strategy. But as I&#x2019;ve said before, investors pursuing common causes don&#x2019;t care about diversifying their portfolios, and instead they should use their portfolio to pull the <i>aggregate</i> investments of philanthropists in line with the Kelly rule investments. This seems to mean going all-in on relatively risky assets.</p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"Zj5Xg4ymXCxcD4Mzd":2,"2ENWEuetHT6ZZzHap":1},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000077,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T08:35:33.035Z","name":"Investing","slug":"investing","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>Investing</strong> tag covers posts about how we can invest our money to produce higher impact, whether we want to increase our expected returns, create stable funding for long-term endeavors, or pursue other goals related to doing more good.</p>\n<p>This differs from the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/socially-responsible-investing\">Socially responsible investing</a> tag, which concerns investments which are directly aimed at generating positive impact.</p>\n<p>(Please be very careful when reading free investment advice distributed on an open online forum.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/patient-altruism\">patient altruism</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/socially-responsible-investing\">socially responsible investing</a></p>\n","postCount":72,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"Zj5Xg4ymXCxcD4Mzd"},{"createdAt":"2021-04-12T18:23:00.065Z","name":"Risk aversion","slug":"risk-aversion","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>An option is more risky if the value of its possible outcomes is more widely dispersed (higher variance).

This claim will be surprising to many, since conversations about the ethics of global health usually focus on more traditional moral issues such as justice, equality, and freedom. While these issues are also important, they are often overshadowed by cost-effectiveness. In this note, I shall explain how this happens and what it means for global health.</p>\n<h2>The Cost-Effectiveness Landscape In Global Health</h2>\n<p>The importance of cost-effectiveness is due to the fact that it varies so much between different interventions. Let us start with a simplified example to show how this becomes a moral consideration. Suppose we have a $40,000 budget which we can spend as we wish to fight blindness. One thing we could do is to provide guide dogs to blind people in the United States to help them overcome their disability. This costs about $40,000 due to the training required for the dog and its recipient.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-1\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another option is to pay for surgeries to reverse the effects of trachoma in Africa. This costs less than $20 per patient cured.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-2\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-2\">[2]</a></sup> There are many other options, but for simplicity, let us just consider these two.</p>\n<p>We could thus use our entire budget to provide a single guide dog, helping one person overcome the challenges of blindness, or we could use it to cure more than 2,000 people of blindness. If we think that people have equal moral value, then the second option is more than 2,000 times better than the first. Put another way, the first option squanders about 99.95% of the value that we could have produced.</p>\n<p>This example illustrates the basic point, but it is also unrealistic in a couple of ways. Firstly, it is rare for treatments in the United States to be traded off against treatments elsewhere. A health budget is normally more restricted than this, with a constraint that it is only spent on people in a particular rich country, or only spent on people in a designated category of poor countries. Secondly, we often have a spectrum of options. Thirdly, and most importantly, the class of interventions under consideration is often broad enough that it is difficult to make direct ‘apples to apples’ comparisons between the effects of two interventions.</p>\n<p>Health economists and moral philosophers have an answer to the third of these issues. They use measures of health benefits that are powerful enough to be able to compare the values of any two health benefits. The standard measure in global health is the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). This measures the disvalue of health conditions in terms of the number of years of life lost due to the condition plus the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a number representing the severity of the disability. For example, a condition that caused one to die 5 years prematurely and to live the last 10 years with deafness would be valued as 5 + (10 x 33.3%) = 8.33 DALYs.</p>\n<p>There are a number of complications and choices regarding the calculation of DALYs, which given rise to a number of subtly different versions of DALYs and the closely related units called QALYs. Chief among these is the question of the size of the weightings representing how bad it is on average to suffer from a particular disability. There are also considerations about discount rates and age weightings. Different reasonable choices on these parameters could change the number of DALYs due to a condition by a few percent or by as much as a factor of two. DALYs should thus be considered only as a rough measure of the disvalue of different conditions.</p>\n<p>It might seem that there would be little use for so rough a measure. This would be true if the difference in cost-effectiveness between interventions were also about a factor of two, but since it is often a factor of a hundred or more, a rough measure is perfectly adequate for making the key comparisons.</p>\n<p>Let us now address all of the three concerns, by looking at a real world example of funding the prevention or treatment of HIV and AIDS. Let us consider four intervention types: surgical treatment for Kaposi’s sarcoma (an AIDS defining illness), antiretroviral therapy to fight the virus in infected people, prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, condom distribution to prevent transmission more generally, and education for high risk groups such as sex workers.</p>\n<p>It is initially very unclear which of these interventions would be best to fund, and one might assume that they are roughly equal in importance. However, the most comprehensive compendium on cost-effectiveness in global health, Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries 2nd edition (hereafter DCP2), lists their estimated cost-effectiveness as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-3\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/dhpcfh1bs3p6/5LwGu131p5pZwZ9cEa1fvC/31dcd6a7d8c99551798775ccdcc323f1/cost-effectiveness-daly-per-1000-fig1.png\" alt=\"Cost Effectiveness DALYs Per $1000: Figure 1\"></p>\n<p>Note the wide discrepancies between the effectiveness of each intervention type. Treatment for Kaposi’s sarcoma cannot be seen on the chart at this scale, but that says more about the other interventions being good than about this treatment being bad: treating Kaposi’s sarcoma is considered cost-effective in a rich country setting. Antiretroviral therapy is estimated to be 50 times as effective as treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma; prevention of transmission during pregnancy is 5 times as effective as this; condom distribution is about twice as effective as that; and education for high risk groups is about twice as effective again. In total, the best of these interventions is estimated to be 1,400 times as cost-effectiveness as the least good, or more than 1,400 times better than it would need to be in order to be funded in rich countries.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy becomes even larger if we make comparisons between interventions targeted at different types of illness. DCP2 includes cost-effectiveness estimates for 108 health interventions, which are presented in the chart below, arranged from least effective to most effective.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-4\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/dhpcfh1bs3p6/3Ymi2TehPKIhNK8LnJkd9p/446a9f0307b946b292eb46d7ce0c6f98/cost-effectiveness-daly-per-1000.png\" alt=\"Cost Effectiveness DALYs Per $1000: Figure 2\"></p>\n<p>This larger sample of interventions is even more disparate in terms of cost-effectiveness. The least effective intervention analysed is still the treatment for Kaposi’s sarcoma, but there are also interventions up to ten times more cost-effective than education for high risk groups. In total, the interventions are spread over more than four orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.02 to 300 DALYs per $1,000, with a median of 5. Thus, moving money from the least effective intervention to the most effective would produce about 15,000 times the benefit, and even moving it from the median intervention to the most effective would produce about 60 times the benefit. It can also be seen that due to the skewed distribution, the most effective interventions produce a disproportionate amount of the benefits. According to the DCP2 data, if we funded all of these interventions equally, 80% of the benefits would be produced by the top 20% of the interventions.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that these are merely estimates of cost-effectiveness and there may be less variance between the real, underlying cost-effectiveness values. However, even if the most effective interventions are a tenth as effective as these figures suggest and the least effective are ten times better than they appear, there would still be a factor of 150 between them.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there have been health interventions that are even more effective than any of those studied in the DCP2. For example, consider the progress that has been made on saving lives lost to immunization preventable illness, diarrhea, malaria, and smallpox, summarized in the following chart:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-5\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/dhpcfh1bs3p6/13ifFwEhyWhbeybcVhCFUw/73cdaf169d420a5b54089609025c9774/deaths-per-annum-by-cause.png\" alt=\"Deaths Per Annum By Cause (Before And After)\"></p>\n<p>In all cases, our interventions have led to at least 2.5 million fewer deaths per year. To aid the reader in comprehending the scale of these achievements, I have added a final bar showing the average number of deaths per year due to war and genocide together over the 20th Century (2.3 million). Thus, in each of the four of these disease areas, our health interventions save more lives than would be saved by a lasting world peace.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these gains have been achieved very cheaply. For instance, in the case of smallpox, the total cost of eradication was about $400 million.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-6\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-6\">[6]</a></sup> Since more than 100 million lives have been saved so far, this has come to less than $4 per life saved — significantly superior to all interventions in the DCP2.</p>\n<p>The eradication also saved significant amounts of money. Approximately $70 million was being spent across developing countries per year in routine vaccination and treatment for smallpox, and more than $1,000 million was lost per year in reduced productivity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-7\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-7\">[7]</a></sup> Even just in the United States, smallpox vaccination and vigilance cost $150 million per year before eradication.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-8\" id=\"fnref-J5HG7aJcEQyrrPSFW-8\">[8]</a></sup> The eradication programme thus saved more lives per year than are lost due to war, while saving money for both donors and recipients, paying back its entire costs every few months. It serves as an excellent proof of just how cost-effective global health can be.</p>\n<h2>The Moral Case</h2>\n<p>In these examples, we have seen how incredibly variable cost-effectiveness can be within global health. The least effective intervention in the HIV/AIDS case produces less than 0.1% of the value of the most effective, and if we are willing to look at different kinds of disease, this fraction drops to less than 0.01%. Ignoring cost-effectiveness thus does not mean losing 10% or 20% of the potential value that a health budget could have achieved, but can easily mean losing 99% or more. Even choosing the median intervention can involve losing 85% of the potential value. In practical terms, this can mean hundreds, thousands, or millions of additional deaths due to failure to prioritize. In non-life-saving contexts, it means thousands or millions of people with untreated disabling conditions.</p>\n<p>Even when other ethical issues in global health are very important in absolute terms, they are typically much smaller than this. For instance, it may be worse on equity grounds to treat a million people in a relatively affluent city than to treat the same number of people spread between the city and the relatively much poorer rural areas. However, it is not vastly worse — not so bad that 99% of the value is lost.</p>\n<p>Learning how to correctly factor these other ethical issues into our decision making is an important and challenging problem, but we are currently failing at a much more basic, more obvious, and more important problem: choosing to help more people instead of fewer people, to produce a larger health benefit instead of a smaller one.</p>\n<h2>Challenges Addressed</h2>\n<p>Some people don’t see cost-effectiveness as an ethical issue at all, since it is so cut and dried that it seems like a mere implementation issue. This is misguided. People who decide how to spend health budgets hold the lives or livelihoods of many other people in their hands. They are literally making life-or-death decisions. Most decisions of this sort take dramatically insufficient account of cost-effectiveness. As a result, thousands or millions of people die who otherwise would have lived. The few are saved at the expense of the many. It is typically done out of ignorance about the significance of the cost-effectiveness landscape rather than out of prejudice, but the effects are equally serious.</p>\n<p>Some object that consequences are not the only thing that matters. For example, some people think that acting virtuously or avoiding violating rights matters too. However, all plausible ethical theories hold that consequences are an important input into moral decision-making, particularly when considering life-or-death situations, or those affecting thousands of people. Indeed, these are precisely the types of cases in which people think that it may even become permissible to violate rights.</p>\n<p>However, in the cases under consideration, there is not even a conflict between producing a much greater good and acting virtuously or avoiding violating people’s rights. The consequences are thus of great moral importance, with no serious moral factors counting in the opposite direction. Proponents of all ethical theories should therefore agree about the moral importance of funding the most cost-effective interventions.</p>\n<p>People might also be concerned about the particular choices involved in estimating the benefits of different health interventions. For example, they may disagree about particular disability weights, or about the method for eliciting these weights, or about discounting health benefits, or weighting benefits depending on the age of the recipients, or whether other issues such as equality need to be factored in. However, none of this is in serious disagreement with the thrust of this note. Indeed, I personally have many of the same concerns — but as mentioned earlier, the practical choices we face often involve factors of ten or more between different interventions, so none of the modifications mentioned here will change the rankings very much. People who are concerned about the details of measuring cost-effectiveness should join with the cost-effectiveness community in improving these measures, rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths.</p>\n<p>Another reason people might be initially suspicious of prioritisation based on cost-effectiveness is through confusing it with cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The latter is an economic method for prioritisation which involves determining the benefits for each person in terms of how many dollars they would be willing to pay, adding these up, and then dividing by the total costs in order to produce a benefit-cost ratio in units of dollars per dollar. This method is ethically suspect, as it considers benefits to wealthy people (or groups) to be worth more than comparable benefits to poorer people (or groups) since the wealthy are willing to pay more for a given benefit.</p>\n<p>However, the cost-effectiveness I have discussed in this note is very different, and is a type of analysis known as cost-effectiveness analysis. This doesn’t convert benefits into dollars, but just provides a raw measure of the benefits in units such as DALYs per dollar, or lives saved per dollar. Thus, the wealth of the recipients is not an input to the analysis, and the analysis doesn’t discriminate towards interventions that favour the wealthy.</p>\n<p>People might remain suspicious of cost-effectiveness because it makes a connection between dollars and health (or even life itself). Making trade-offs between so-called sacred values such as life with non-sacred values such as money strikes many people as morally problematic. However, no such trade-off is made in cost-effectiveness analysis. Instead, there is a budget constraint of some fixed number of dollars. The cost-effectiveness ratios help one to see how much benefit could be causally produced if this money were spent on different interventions — for example, saving one thousand lives or saving ten thousand lives. The only comparison that is made is between these benefits. Whether or not it is worth spending the budget to save ten thousand lives is not part of the analysis.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>In many cases, ignoring cost-effectiveness in global health means losing almost all the value that we could create. Thus, there is a moral imperative to fund the most cost-effective interventions.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t simply mean implementing the current interventions in the most cost-effective way possible, for the improvements that can be gained within a single intervention are quite small in comparison. It also doesn’t just mean doing retrospective measures of the cost-effectiveness of the interventions you fund as part of programme evaluation. Instead, it means actively searching the landscape of interventions that you are allowed to fund and diverting the bulk of the funds to the very best interventions. Ideally, it also means expanding the domain of interventions under consideration to include all those which have been analysed.</p>\n<p>The main effect of understanding the moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness is spending our budgets so as to produce greater health benefits, saving many more lives and preventing or treating more disabling conditions. However, it also shows a very interesting fact about global health funding. If we can save one thousand lives with one intervention and ten thousand with another at an equal price, then merely moving our funding from the first to the second saves nine thousand lives. Thus, merely moving funding from one intervention to a more cost-effective one can produce almost as much benefit as adding an equal amount of additional funding. This is unintuitive because it isn’t the case when one option is merely 10% or 30% better than another. However, when one option is 10 times or 100 times better, as is often the case in global health, redirecting funding is so important that it is almost as good as adding new funding directly towards the superior intervention. In times of global austerity and shrinking budgets, it is good to know how much more can be done within existing ones.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Joseph Cook, et al. 2006. ‘Loss of vision and hearing’ in Jamison et al.

When I support the world&#x2019;s poorest people I&#x2019;m not just alleviating their suffering, I&#x2019;m increasing the productivity of their lives. The recipients of aid go on to contribute to the world, and their contributions compound in turn.</p>\n<p>Moreover, one can <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#Whatreturnoninvestmentdocashtransferrecipientsearn\">argue</a> that the returns to aid are much higher than achievable financial returns. Equities make around 5% in real terms, while the world&#x2019;s poorest earn returns upwards of 20%. And that&#x2019;s not surprising&#x2014;more people are interested in making money than are interested in improving the world, so we should expect it to be harder to find opportunities to make money than opportunities to improve the world.</p>\n<p>So, the argument goes, altruists ought to donate as quickly as possible, doing good works that will compound out there in the world much faster than they will compound in their bank accounts. Make sense?</p>\n<p>I think this argument is mistaken.<span></span></p>\n<p>Here&#x2019;s the problem: if you give your money well, it might compound much faster than it would have in your bank account&#x2014;but only for a while. Over time the positive effects will spread out more and more, across a broader and broader group of beneficiaries, until eventually you are just contributing to a representative basket of all human activities. Eventually, my investment will compound at the rate of world economic growth, rather than at the particularly promising interest rate I was able to originally identify.</p>\n<p>When I leave money in my bank account, it compounds slightly (1-2%, conservatively) <i>faster</i> than world economic growth. It does this for years, until I decide to spend it, for example on developing world aid. At that point it will earn anomalously high returns for a while, before being spread out throughout the world and then compounding in line with world economic growth. If I donate a year later, I earn 1 <i>extra</i> year of market returns, and 1 <i>less</i> year of compounding in line with economic growth. That&#x2019;s a good deal&#x2014;an extra 1-2%.</p>\n<p>What I really care about is the extra multiplier I get right after I donate my money, before it resumes compounding at the usual rate. E.g., if my investment compounds 5% faster than economic growth for 15 years, my money is being effectively doubled, when compared to an investment that compounded with growth all along. That multiplier isn&#x2019;t changing a lot over time (it might increase or decrease as good charitable opportunities arise or dry up, but there&#x2019;s no good a priori reason to expect it to decrease steadily with time).</p>\n<p>So if I&#x2019;m considering donating to a cause like developing world aid, I shouldn&#x2019;t donate sooner rather than later just because poor folks can earn higher returns than I can. I should instead look at the total multiplier I&#x2019;m getting on my money, and donate iff I expect that multiplier is <i>declining</i> faster than [(market rates of return) - (economic growth)]. I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ve found many causes for which this is plausibly the case, and I think that aid is definitely not one of them.</p>\n<p>The basic issue is that philanthropists <i>aren&#x2019;t</i> much less selfish than normal people, instrumentally. Even if you care about other people, you would much prefer that you make $1 than that someone else make $2, since when you make $1 you can use it to create more than $2 of value. (Of course this wouldn&#x2019;t be true in a world with many altruists, in which the returns to altruistic endeavors were less fantastic.)</p>\n<p>In the very long run I expect interest rates to fall / growth rates to rise until the two are equal, and I expect the multiplier on altruistic investments to decrease until it&#x2019;s 1. But those events look to be a long way off.</p>\n<h2><b>Is giving later really an option?</b></h2>\n<p>There are at least four other reasons to give now rather than later:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Giving can send a social signal, which is useful for encouraging more giving, building communities, demonstrating our generosity, and coordinating with charities. (Who are more likely to take a community of donors seriously than a community of people saying &#x201C;maybe we&#x2019;ll donate in the future.)</li>\n<li>Our priorities may change over time, and we would prefer that our future selves not have the option to keep money for themselves.</li>\n<li>Eventually we will die, and it is very hard to build institutions which will carry out our mission after our death.</li>\n<li>Taxes favor giving as you earn. (You can only deduct donations against this year&#x2019;s income, and in the US at least you can only deduct 50% of your income in this way, so someone looking to donate a large fraction of their income will be deduction-opportunity-limited, and will want to use up all of the available deductions each year.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe that these are serious considerations. However, &#x201C;give now&#x201D; is just one possible solution to these challenges, and if &#x201C;give later&#x201D; would otherwise be a much better strategy, it is worth searching for alternative solutions. Moreover, I expect that I&#x2019;ll have a much better idea of how to spend charitable dollars in the future. So I would like to hold on to my money even if it weren&#x2019;t earning interest, and I would need to confront these problems anyway.</p>\n<p>Donor advised funds, or more generally donating to 501(c)3&#x2032;s which invest, may resolve some of these problems. Giving to a DAF serves as a binding commitment to give, and therefore overcomes problem 2 and some of problem 1. Contributions to DAFs have the same tax status as donations, so overcome problem 4. Potentially the existence of such funds could also facilitate community-building and coordination with charities, perhaps even more effectively than an established record of giving.</p>\n<p>At the moment donor advised funds typically charge management fees of about 0.6% / year on top of normal management fees, and tend to place more restrictions on grants than are legally mandated. In principle, it seems that US charities are free to invest arbitrarily (and  subsume arbitrary for-profit enterprises), and use investment income to finance their activities or make grants.</p>\n<p>It is tempting to imagine a charitable fund designed to accommodate very long-term giving, organized as a 501(c)3 and not charging significant annual management fees. Such a fund might seek out philosophically aligned donors and adopt a governance structure which codifies their shared values (representing a more credible commitment to to the charities that might want to coordinate with those donors). It might go further and actively manage its funds, hiring philosophically aligned traders and analysts, who would be happier to see the surplus they create split between themselves and philanthropists with similar values. I don&#x2019;t know whether this is possible, but it seems worth thinking about.</p>\n<p>Problem 3 appears to be significantly more difficult, but might be addressed in part by the same mechanisms. Donor advised funds provide a legal framework in which donated funds can be preserved without suffering from estate taxes or the mandated 5% payout of foundations. If there were enough like-minded philanthropists, it may be possible to allow each philanthropist to pass of advisory control of their funds to a like-minded successor before they became unable to oversee them themselves. Making such a fund stable enough to resist gradual value drift or pillaging would be a significant challenge.</p>\n<p>The historical record is conspicuously devoid of successful enterprises of this kind, which suggests that future outings in this genre are doomed to fail. But I don&#x2019;t think this is such strong evidence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I know of few serious attempts to create institutions which would build up wealth while resisting value drift or collapse. Today may be special just because today we think of different plans than our ancestors thought of.</li>\n<li>We have access to more effective communication/coordination mechanisms than were available historically. It may now be possible to reliably identify a like-minded and similarly able successor who shares your values even if the social prevalence of those values is one in a million or lower.</li>\n<li>I think there is a reasonable probability that we are in an unprecedentedly stable legal and political regime which will last longer than any preceding regime. Moreover, we now have a global political infrastructure which lets us build financial entities that can survive changes or collapse in one country by moving to another.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if &#x201C;give <i>much</i> later&#x201D; looks like a good strategy, I think we should seriously consider trying to make it work, rather than throwing up our hands and saying &#x201C;at least we can get <i>some</i> value by giving now.&#x201D;</p>\n<h2><b>Can good works grow faster than the world around them?</b></h2>\n<p>The argument above is based on an empirical claim: good deeds tend to grow at the same speed as the world at large, rather than growing much faster. Equivalently: measured as a <i>fraction</i> of the world, the positive changes we effect don&#x2019;t continue growing indefinitely. (While money in your bank account steadily increases as a fraction of the world&#x2019;s wealth.) For some interventions, like existential risk reduction or undirected economic boosts, this is true almost definitionally (and I consider risk reduction an unusually <i>forward-looking</i> strategy, rather than unusually short-sighted).</p>\n<p>Something that compounds faster than economic growth necessarily represents an increasing fraction of the world, and if it continues compounding faster than economic growth for long enough it will eventually make up a large fraction of the world and single-handedly increase the growth rates. This is rarely realistic for the kinds of investments we consider.</p>\n<p>Instead, what happens is that the returns from an investment are typically not that concentrated. If I improve the educational system, this may make the world significantly better, but very little of that improvement will occur within the educational system itself. Instead, that improvement will be scattered out across many different endeavors (which will in turn spread their outputs even more widely). Even if the returns to education are very large, they will eventually spread out through society and compound at the usual rate <i>unless</i> the product [(returns to education) times (fraction of returns that are reinvested in education)] exceeds the economic growth rate.</p>\n<p>In general, for a class X of investments to compound faster than economic growth rate, it would need to be the case that [(returns to X) times (fraction of returns reinvested in X)] exceeds the growth rate. If X is a small or very specialized class of investments (like education), it is hard for &#x201C;fraction of returns reinvested in X&#x201D; to be large. If X is a large natural class of investments (like the economy of the US), it is hard for &#x201C;returns to X&#x201D; to be far above market returns.</p>\n<p>Investment seems to have anomalously good internal returns. I think this is possible because someone is actively applying significant effort to ensure that the returns from one opportunity are reinvested exclusively in the most promising opportunities (and a lot of effort has gone into building the legal and economic infrastructure that can support this). The same thing applies within a firm, although usually firms eventually encounter diminishing returns and their growth slows or stops.</p>\n<p>Even so, the above argument implies that it is impossible for an investor to earn market returns for too long (or else they would eventually have all of the money). In practice, investors are able to earn market returns while they invest, but eventually they take their money out of the market or die, and they do not form lasting lineages of investors.</p>\n<p>There may be other opportunities that have the same important properties as investment. For example, I might be able to efficiently support individuals or organizations that share my values, and therefore might be able to pursue other high-return investments after they have used up their own capacity for growth.  It is plausible to me that supporting a growing community of &#x201C;effective altruists&#x201D; might have this effect.</p>\n\n<p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"FBTCnrdQp9aDa6AJ3":2,"mMC3LEMAJWx4FbHW3":2},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":0,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000062,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-12-28T14:23:35.786Z","name":"Timing of philanthropy","slug":"timing-of-philanthropy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>timing of philanthropy</strong> is the selection of the optimal schedule for philanthropic donations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/investing\">investing</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/patient-altruism\">patient altruism</a></p>\n","postCount":54,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"FBTCnrdQp9aDa6AJ3"},{"createdAt":"2020-08-11T23:22:48.179Z","name":"Patient altruism","slug":"patient-altruism","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Patient altruism</strong> (sometimes called <strong>patient longtermism</strong>) is the view that individuals can have a greater positive impact by investing current altruistic resources and spending them later than by spending them now.

There&apos;s a decent case to be made that aiming to do good is one of the best ways of having a career that is personally satisfying. In general, I think that a great research program for practical ethics is to find out what policies or personal activities are in the class of &quot;win-wins&quot;. That is: what actions or activities can we recommend that, if undertaken, make the actor personally better off and also result in a better outcome for others? (Activities that improve self-control, such as mindfulness meditation, might be in this category.).

I worry that recommendations in this category are often neglected by practical ethics simply because &quot;acting morally&quot; has such strong connotations of self-sacrifice. (It sounds kind of odd to talk of &quot;the moral imperative to promoting mindfulness meditation&quot;.) But it need not be so. What&apos;s good for yourself and what&apos;s good for the world are logically independent, and sometimes they overlap in unexpected ways.

Let me explain:</p>\n<p>The Why is to make the world as good a place as it can possibly be. Rather than merely aiming to make the world better than when we found it &#x2014; &quot;to make <strong>a</strong> difference&quot; &#x2014; we want to make <strong>the most</strong> difference. So, for example, rather than simply trying to find a development charity that &#x201C;does good work&#x201D;, Giving What We Can seeks to find those charities that do the very most to help people in developing countries with every pound or dollar they receive. In general, we seek out those activities that will do the most good with our time or money.</p>\n<p>The How &#x2014; how to find those activities that do the most good &#x2014; is by using good evidence and good reasoning. Where a question concerns a matter of fact, we try to find the best empirical evidence that is relevant to that question. (An anecdote is bad, a double-blind randomized controlled trial is better, a well-performed meta-analysis is best.) Where a question concerns values, we use clear arguments, rational reflection, and the latest insights from ethics, economics, and psychology to help us come to the right view. So, for example, rather than going with feel-good slogans like &#x201C;follow your passion&#x201D;, or passing on anecdotes about specific people, at 80,000 Hours we&#x2019;re busy digging into all the available academic research related to doing good through your career, and getting clear, conceptually, on what making a difference involves.</p>\n<p>From these two ideas, the What follows. Effective altruists currently tend to think that the most important causes to focus on are global poverty, factory farming, and the long-term future of life on Earth. I&apos;ll talk more about the reasons why these are generally thought to be the highest-impact cause areas in later posts, but in each case, the reasoning is that the stakes are very high, and there is the potential to make a lot of progress. Right now, within the <a href=\"http://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, the What consists of the organisations listed to the right: organisations that, for example, promote donating a good chunk of one&apos;s income to the causes that most effectively fight global poverty (<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/\">The Life You Can Save</a>); or that advise individuals on which careers enable them to have the greatest positive impact (<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>); or that try to figure out how best to improve animal welfare (<a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/\">Effective Animal Activism</a>). But these activities are just our current best guesses.

The idea was this: instead of the typical hand-pump, found in many developing-world villages to provide water for the community, PlayPumps International would install playground merry-go-rounds that would pump up water from deep underground as children played on them. The children would get often their first playground amenity, and the village would get clean water &#x2014; it was a clear win-win.</p><p>Soon, Playpumps International was raking in awards and accolades &#x2014; a $10 million grant from the US Government, announced by First Lady Laura Bush, a World Bank Development Marketplace Awared, and even a site visit and sponsorship from Jay-Z. The international media swooped in to report the story, loving both the startling innovation and the opportunity to pun on &#x201C;pumping water is child&#x2019;s play&#x201D; and &#x201C;the magic roundabout&#x201D;. At the centre of it all was Trevor Field, the founder of PlayPumps International. He reported: &#x201C;It really rocks me to know we&#x2019;re making a difference to a lot of people who are nowhere near as privileged as I am or my family is.&#x201D;</p><p>The only problem with PlayPumps International was that the idea wasn&#x2019;t actually any good. There were many problems, and I&#x2019;ll just mention a few.</p><p>First, unlike normal playground merry-go-rounds, which spin freely once they&#x2019;ve gained sufficient momentum, in order to pump water the PlayPumps needed constant force. The kids, understandably, would get tired very quickly, and didn&#x2019;t want to &#x2018;play&#x2019; on the pumps at all hours of the day. So it would often be left to the women of the village, who would struggle to push the additional weight, and would sometimes vomit while the pump was in motion. In one town, children were actually paid by the locals to &#x2018;play&#x2019; on the pumps.</p><p>The second problem was the lack of consultation and maintenance. When the UN investigated the efficacy of PlayPumps in Zambia, the majority of users said that they hadn&#x2019;t been asked whether they wanted the pumps and that they preferred the handpump that had been removed to make way for the PlayPump. Most didn&#x2019;t know who to contact in case the pump needed repair &#x2014; which a large proportion of pumps did.</p><p>Finally, there was the cost. Though initially touted at $6500 per pump, the price rose without explanation to $14 000. Though that might not sound like much, that&#x2019;s equivalent to 64 years of local wages, and several times the cost of a standard handpump (which could also pump more water per hour). So donors were paying several times as much for a worse product.</p><p>In an interview prior to the public realisation that the PlayPumps program had been a disaster, Trevor Fields was asked what his one piece of advice would be. He said: &#x201C;The best advice I&#x2019;ve ever received, ever, is to, and everybody says this, but it&#x2019;s true, believe in yourself. You&#x2019;ve got to believe in your idea&#x2026; So the best advice that I&#x2019;ve ever got was that you&#x2019;ve just got to do it. It&#x2019;s like the Nike slogan. You&#x2019;ve just got to do it.&#x201D;</p><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to helping others &#x201C;just do it&#x201D; and &#x201C;believe in your idea&#x201D; are probably the stupidest pieces of advice you could offer (rather than, say, &#x201C;do your research&#x201D;). Luckily for the world, PlayPumps International was decent enough to admit it was game over and folded in March 2010.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"sWcuTyTB5dP3nas2t":2,"X2jgq6Zf58PveQMkc":2},"voteCount":5,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000078,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T23:09:43.581Z","name":"Global health and development","slug":"global-health-and-development","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>global health and development</strong> tag can cover any post about improving public health, reducing poverty, or increasing economic growth; most of these posts will discuss the developing world, but this isn't strictly necessary.</p><p>In 2013, roughly 767 million people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 per day, adjusted for purchasing power.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefphn1q4i5kdb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnphn1q4i5kdb\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Lack of economic resources has direct consequences on many aspects of people’s lives, including access to education and healthcare.

What does that mean?</p>\n<p>What it doesn’t mean is that these people are living on what $1.25 could buy in, say, Kenya. If you thought that, then you might think that $1.25 isn’t so bad, because money goes much further in developing countries.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the fact that the money goes further in such countries has already been taken into account. What “$1.25 per day” means is: people living on this amount consume the goods equivalent of what $1.25 could buy in the US in 2005. That is to say, the figure is purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted. That means we can work out how much, in actual money, people in Kenya live on below this line. In 2005, the purchasing power parity conversion factor was US$1 to 29.5 Kenyan Shillings. So $1.25 is about 37 Kenyan Shillings. At market exchange rate (today’s rate, so again this is only a rough estimate), that’s 44¢.</p>\n<p>Because that’s still talking about 2005 money, we want to adjust for inflation, so, assuming 3% inflation per year (again, keeping it rough), that’s 56¢. &nbsp;So, in my view more accurately, we should say that the global poor, in Kenya at least - though other countries at an equivalent level of economic development have similar PPP conversion factors - live on 56¢ per day. Jeez.</p>\n<p>However, the story doesn’t end there, because “$1.25/day” doesn’t refer to income. It is based on measurements of consumption. So when a person gather sticks from the forest for their own use — that counts as ‘consumption’. Similarly, as far as I understand it, any free services provided by the government count in this as well.</p>\n<p>So I think a more intuitive way to think about extreme poverty is: if you gave a Kenyan living below that poverty line 56¢, you’d have doubled what they can consume in a day.</p>\n<p>A lot of people who know this about the $1.25 a day line subsequently refuse to believe it. &nbsp;I really struggle to believe it. Surely, if someone lived in the US on $1.25 a day, they would die! (I heard this argued in a conference on poverty by an academic who’d written several articles on poverty.)</p>\n<p>If we’re referring to income, I think that’s simply not true. With an income of $1.25 a day you could have a much better quality of life than the extremely poor. You can dumpster dive and live off the excess of the affluent country; they have free access to roads and lighting, a good legal system and police protection, and medical assistance if they get sick. I know someone who lived on $1000 per year for a couple of years — several times more than the extreme poor, but he had a really pretty reasonable quality of life.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re thinking about consumption rather than income (as you should), there is a difference which does make the comparison to “$1.25 living in the US” misleading: in the US you just can’t buy the sort of low-quality goods that you can in developing countries. Markets just don’t exist for those goods. Even the most basic lentils and rice sold at Walmart in the US would be regarded as a luxury item for people living on $1.25 a day.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"sWcuTyTB5dP3nas2t":5},"voteCount":15,"baseScore":26,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000182,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T23:09:43.581Z","name":"Global health and development","slug":"global-health-and-development","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>global health and development</strong> tag can cover any post about improving public health, reducing poverty, or increasing economic growth; most of these posts will discuss the developing world, but this isn't strictly necessary.</p><p>In 2013, roughly 767 million people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 per day, adjusted for purchasing power.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefphn1q4i5kdb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnphn1q4i5kdb\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Lack of economic resources has direct consequences on many aspects of people’s lives, including access to education and healthcare.

I was asked to post the story of how I got involved with giving on The Life You Can Save website, so thought I&apos;d post it here too.</p><p>It began in a graveyard. In May 2009, I first met Toby Ord &#x2014; in the gardens of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, which double as a place for burying the dead. I&apos;d read Peter Singer&apos;s work, and was terribly concerned by the problem of extreme poverty, and was looking for someone who was really taking these idea and putting them into practice. But I&apos;d found that though almost all my philosophical colleagues agreed that Singer&apos;s arguments were correct, no-one was really living by them. I&apos;d read on Toby&apos;s website that he said he was giving &apos;the required amount&apos;, but I was very sceptical about whether he really was.</p><p>In that conversation (&#x201C;getting a coffee&#x201D; that lasted for 5 hours), though, he told me about his pledge to give everything he earned above &#xA3;20 000 per year to the charities that do the most good, and blew my mind.</p><p>I remember I expressed visible shock when he first told me. Feeling a bit taken aback, and entirely misunderstanding my reaction, he earnestly explained that the &#xA3;20 000 figure was a &#x201C;high bar&#x201D;, and that really he gave much more than this &#x2014; living on &#xA3;11 000, saving &#xA3;2 000, and donating the rest. He wanted to make sure he didn&#x2019;t publicly commit to a lower figure, he explained, so that he had some breathing space in case he faced any personal emergencies. But otherwise he would have committed to donating more.</p><p>It was at that point that I knew I was dealing with something new.</p><p>&#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t most aid ineffective?&#x201D; I asked. &#x201C;How do you know if it does any good?&#x201D; He went on to explain to me at length the different metrics for evaluating charity cost-effectiveness, how you can use research from health economics to find out which are the charities that are really having a massive impact. He told me that by donating to the very most cost-effective charities, you can save a life for mere thousands of dollars. It turned out that he&#x2019;d spent several years researching this question. &#x201C;Hundreds of lives are on the line,&#x201D; he told me. &#x201C;So it&#x2019;s important to get it right.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;How did you choose the &#xA3;20 000 figure?&#x201D; He acknowledged that it was a little arbitrary. But he thought that it was better to have some fixed amount that he lived on, rather than have to decide every financial transaction on its own merits. He used to agonise over which type of cereal to buy every time he went to the supermarket &#x2014; is this something that&#x2019;s worth the extra expense? &#x2014; and he thought it would be better for his motivation in the long run just to make one commitment and stick with it.</p><p>&#x201C;What about your wife? She&#x2019;s a doctor, right? So will she be paying the bills?&#x201D; I really thought I&#x2019;d got him at this point &#x2014; easy for him if he&#x2019;s got a high-earning spouse to live off. But then he explained politely that she was doing the same thing &#x2014; giving everything about &#xA3;25,000. After that, I stopped trying to be critical and just accepted his story. He had it all thought out. I started to reflect on whether I could do the same, and what my worries about doing so were, so I asked one last question.</p><p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you feel like a sucker?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;No,&#x201D; he replied. &#x201C;Actually I think it&#x2019;s people who aren&#x2019;t doing this that are the suckers &#x2014; many people care about global poverty, and want to help, and they&#x2019;re just not living up to their own values. I used to have a niggling feeling of guilt in the back of my mind &#x2014; that I should be doing something, even though I wasn&#x2019;t. But I don&#x2019;t have that anymore. I&#x2019;m much happier now.&#x201D;</p><p>From then on, I was on board, and eagerly got involved in helping to set up Giving What We Can, and did quite a lot of the original cost-effectiveness research. I now give 10% of my PhD stipend, have pledged to give everything I earn above &#xA3;20,000, and want to dedicate my life to doing whatever does the most good.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":3,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000082,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"6ytoanpFegbZCC5di","postedAt":"2013-05-22T04:00:50.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Peter Singer's TED talk on effective altruism","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":null,"pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6ytoanpFegbZCC5di/peter-singer-s-ted-talk-on-effective-altruism","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>Peter Singer gave a TED talk on &quot;The Why and How of Effective Altruism,&quot; which you can watch <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">here</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s been interesting to look at people&apos;s reactions both on the TED website, and on Youtube.

In brief: GiveWell have consistently found that the cost-effectiveness estimates of the best interventions are too optimistic. This is a to-be-expected example of regression to the mean . But Jonah has found that this effect has occurred much more than he would have thought before he worked for GiveWell. So he urges you to go with more robust evidence of good but lower cost-effectiveness over less robust but higher cost-effectiveness, and suggests that this might be a mistake that EAs make more generally.</p><p>I&apos;m pretty sympathetic to the thrust of the post, but I had a couple of immediate thoughts.</p><p>First, Jonah talks about &quot;lives saved per dollar&quot; - but what EAs are ultimately concerned about is &quot;good done per dollar&quot;. But, for me, the amount of good I can do per dollar is far greater than I initially would have thought. This is because, in my initial analysis - and in what I&apos;d presume are most people&apos;s initial analyses - benefits to the long-term future of civilisation weren&apos;t taken into account, or weren&apos;t thought to be morally relevant. (Example: saving a life doesn&apos;t just benefit that person, but also, because the person is economically productive, benefits all of society. Moreover, these economic benefits continue through the generations and in fact compound at a rate roughly equal to general economic growth). But those (expected) benefits strike me, and strike most people I&apos;ve spoken with who agree with the moral relevance of them, to be far greater than the short-term benefits to the person whose life is saved. So, in terms of my expectations about how much good I can do in the world, I&apos;m able to exceed those by a far greater amount than I&apos;d previously thought likely. And that holds true whether it costs $2000 or $20000 to save a life. So the lesson to take from past updates on evidence can look quite different depending on whether you&apos;re talking about &quot;good done per dollar&quot; or &quot;lives saved per dollar&quot;, and the former is what we ultimately care about.</p><p>Second, something Jonah doesn&apos;t mention is that, when you find out that your evidence is poorer than you&apos;d thought, two general lessons are to pursue activities with high option value and to pay to gain new evidence (though this lesson do only follow if you think you can get a decent amount of new evidence in the future). Building a movement of people who are aiming to do the most good with their marginal resources, and who are trying to work out how best to do that, strikes me as a good way to achieve both of these things, and it&apos;s been a major factor in my decision to focus on building the effective altruism movement in general, rather than focusing on any one specific activity.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"o2FZJuxRGHKvXM6HS":2},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":3,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000081,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-28T09:17:29.081Z","name":"Statistics","slug":"statistics","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.</p><p>This tag isn't meant for posts that estimate the impact of specific charities or interventions, but instead for posts about \"doing statistics\" in general.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/data-science\">data science</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/impact-assessment\">impact assessment</a></p>","postCount":44,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"o2FZJuxRGHKvXM6HS"}]},{"_id":"RXpJbWKDJ7WFWqEin","postedAt":"2013-05-27T04:00:57.000Z","modifiedAt":"2021-02-10T00:37:40.625Z","title":"A proposed adjustment to the astronomical waste argument","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2013-05-27T04:00:57.000Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RXpJbWKDJ7WFWqEin/a-proposed-adjustment-to-the-astronomical-waste-argument","htmlBody":"<html><body><p></p><div>\n<p>An <em>existential risk</em> is a risk &#x201C;that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development,&#x201D; (<a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html\">Bostrom</a>, 2013). <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/\">Nick Bostrom</a> has <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html\">argued that</a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;[T]he loss in expected value resulting from an existential catastrophe is so enormous that the objective of reducing existential risks should be a dominant consideration whenever we act out of an impersonal concern for humankind as a whole. It may be useful to adopt the following rule of thumb for such impersonal moral action:</p>\n<p>Maxipok: Maximize the probability of an &#x201C;OK outcome,&#x201D; where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids existential catastrophe.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>There are a number of people in the <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">effective altruism</a>&#xA0;community who accept this view and cite Bostrom&#x2019;s argument as their primary justification. Many of these people also believe that the best ways of minimizing existential risk involve making plans to prevent specific existential catastrophes from occurring, and believe that the best giving opportunities must be with charities that primarily focus on reducing existential risk. They also appeal to Bostrom&#x2019;s argument to support their views. (Edited to add: Note that Bostrom himself sees maxipok as neutral on the question of whether the best methods of reducing existential risk are very broad and general, or highly targeted and specific.) For one example of this, see Luke Muehlhauser&#x2019;s <a href=\"/lw/di4/reply_to_holden_on_the_singularity_institute/\">comment</a>:</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Many humans living today value both current and future people enough that&#xA0;<em>if</em>&#xA0;existential catastrophe is plausible this century, then upon reflection (e.g. after counteracting their unconscious, default&#xA0;<a href=\"/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">scope insensitivity</a>) they would conclude that reducing the risk of existential catastrophe is the most valuable thing they can do &#x2014; whether through direct work or by&#xA0;<a href=\"http://singularity.org/donate/\">donating</a>&#xA0;to support direct work.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>I now think these views require some significant adjustments and qualifications, and given these adjustments and qualifications, their practical implications become very uncertain. I still believe that what matters most about what we do is how our actions affect humanity&#x2019;s long-term future potential, and I still believe that targeted existential risk reduction and research is a promising cause, but it now seems unclear whether targeted existential risk reduction is the best area to look for ways of making the distant future go as well as possible. It may be and it may not be, and which is right probably depends on many messy details about specific opportunities, as well as general methodological considerations which are, at this point, highly uncertain. Various considerations played a role in my reasoning about this, and I intend to talk about more of them in greater detail in the future. I&#x2019;ll talk about just a couple of these considerations in this post.</p>\n<p>In this post, I argue that:</p><p></p><p></p><ol>\n\t<li><strong>Though Bostrom&#x2019;s argument supports the conclusion that maximizing humanity&#x2019;s long term potential is extremely important, it does not provide strong evidence that reducing existential risk is the best way of maximizing humanity&#x2019;s future potential.</strong><span> There is a much broader class of actions which may affect humanity&#x2019;s long-term potential, and Bostrom&#x2019;s argument does not uniquely favor existential risk over other members in this class.</span></li>\n\t<li><strong>A version of Bostrom&#x2019;s argument better supports a more general view: what matters most is that we make path-dependent aspects of the far future go as well as possible. </strong><span>There are important questions about whether we should accept this more general view and what its practical significance is, but this more general view seems to be a strict improvement on the view that minimizing existential risk is what matters most.</span></li>\n\t<li><strong>The above points favor very broad, general, and indirect approaches to shaping the far future for the better</strong><span>, rather than thinking about very specific risks and responses, though there are many relevant considerations and the issue is far from settled.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span>I think some prominent advocates of existential risk reduction already agree with these general points, and believe that other arguments, or other arguments together with Bostrom&#x2019;s argument, establish that direct existential risk reduction is what matters most. This post is most relevant to people who currently think Bostrom&#x2019;s arguments may settle the issues discussed above.</span>\n<h2>Path-dependence and trajectory changes</h2>\n<p>In thinking about how we might affect the far future, I&apos;ve found it useful to use the concept of the world&apos;s <em>development trajectory</em>, or just trajectory for short. The world&apos;s development trajectory, as I use the term, is a rough summary way the future will unfold over time. The summary includes various facts about the world that matter from a macro perspective, such as how rich people are, what technologies are available, how happy people are, how developed our science and culture is along various dimensions, and how well things are going all-things-considered at different points of time. It may help to think of the trajectory as a collection of graphs, where each graph in the collection has time on the x-axis and one of these other variables on the y-axis.</p>\n<p>With that concept in place, consider three different types of benefits from doing good. First, doing something good might have <em>proximate benefits</em>&#x2014;this is the name I give to the fairly short-run, fairly predictable benefits that we ordinarily think about when we cure some child&apos;s blindness, save a life, or help an old lady cross the street. Second, there are <em>benefits from speeding up development</em>. In many cases, <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">ripple effects</a>&#xA0;from good ordinary actions speed up development. For example, saving some child&apos;s life might cause his country&apos;s economy to develop very slightly more quickly, or make certain technological or cultural innovations arrive more quickly. Third, our actions may slightly or significantly alter the world&apos;s development trajectory. I call these shifts <em>trajectory changes</em>. If we ever prevent an existential catastrophe, that would be an extreme example of a trajectory change. There may also be smaller trajectory changes. For example, if some species of dolphins that we really loved were destroyed, that would be a much smaller trajectory change.</p>\n<p>The concept of a trajectory change is closely related to the concept of path dependence in the social sciences, though when I talk about trajectory changes I am interested in effects that persist much longer than standard examples of path dependence. A classic example of path dependence is our use of QWERTY keyboards. Our keyboards could have been arranged in any number of other possible ways. A large part of the explanation of why we use QWERTY keyboards is that it happened to be convenient for making typewriters, that a lot of people learned to use these keyboards, and there are advantages to having most people use the same kind of keyboard. In essence, there is path dependence whenever some aspect of the future could easily have been way X, but it is arranged in way Y due to something that happened in the past, and now it would be hard or impossible to switch to way X. Path dependence is especially interesting when way X would have been better than way Y. Some political scientists have argued that path dependence is very common in politics. For example, in an influential paper (with over 3000 citations) <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2586011?uid=3739576&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101564634081\">Pierson</a> (2000, p. 251) argues that:</p>\n<p>Specific patterns of timing and sequence matter; a wide range of social outcomes may be possible; large consequences may result from relatively small or contingent events; particular courses of action, once introduced, can be almost impossible to reverse; and consequently, political development is punctuated by critical moments or junctures that shape the basic contours of social life.</p>\n<p>The concept of a trajectory change is also closely related to the concept of a historical contingency. If Thomas Edison had not invented the light bulb, someone else would have done it later. In this sense, it is not historically contingent that we have light bulbs, and the most obvious benefits from Thomas Edison inventing the light bulb are proximate benefits and benefits from speeding up development. Something analogous is probably true of many other technological innovations such as computers, candles, wheelbarrows, object-oriented programming, and the printing press. Some important examples of historical contingencies: the rise of Christianity, the creation of the US Constitution, and the writings of Karl Marx. Various aspects of Christian morality influence the world today in significant ways, but the fact that those aspects of morality, in exactly those ways, were part of a dominant world religion was historically contingent. And therefore events like Jesus&apos;s death and Paul writing his epistles are examples of trajectory changes. Likewise, the US Constitution was the product of deliberation among a specific set of men, the document affects government policy today and will affect it for the foreseeable future, but it could easily have been a different document. And now that the document exists in its specific legal and historical context, it is challenging to make changes to it, so the change is somewhat self-reinforcing.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Some small trajectory changes could be suboptimal</h2>\n<p>Persistent trajectory changes that do not involve existential catastrophes could have great significance for shaping the far future. It is unlikely that the far future will inherit many of our institutions exactly as they are, but <strong>various aspects of the far future&#x2014;including social norms, values, political systems, and perhaps even some technologies&#x2014;may be path dependent on what happens now, and sometimes in suboptimal ways.</strong> In general, it is reasonable to assume that if there is some problem that might exist in the future and we can do something to fix it now, future people would also be able to solve that problem. But if values or social norms change, they might not agree that some things we think are problems <em>really are</em> problems. Or, if people make the wrong decisions now, certain standards or conventions may get entrenched, and resulting problems may be too expensive to be worth fixing. For further categories of examples of path-dependent aspects of the far future, see <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/12/long-legacies.html\">these</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/10/how-plastic-are-people.html\">posts</a>&#xA0;by <a href=\"http://hanson.gmu.edu/\">Robin Hanson</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>The astronomical waste argument and trajectory changes</h2>\n<p>Bostrom&#x2019;s argument only works if reducing existential risk is the most effective way of maximizing humanity&#x2019;s future potential. But<strong> there is no robust argument that trying to reduce existential risk is a more effective way of shaping the far future than trying to create other positive trajectory changes. </strong>Bostrom&#x2019;s argument for the overwhelming importance of reducing existential risk can be summarized as follows:<strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p><ol>\n\t<li><span>The expected size of humanity&apos;s future influence is astronomically great.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>If the expected size of humanity&apos;s future influence is astronomically great, then the expected value of the future is astronomically great.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>If&#xA0;the expected value of the future is astronomically great, then what matters most is that we maximize humanity&#x2019;s long-term potential.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Some of our actions are expected to reduce existential risk in not-ridiculously-small ways.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>If what matters most is that we maximize humanity&#x2019;s future potential and some of our actions are expected to reduce existential risk in not-ridiculously-small ways, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to reduce existential risk.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Therefore, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to reduce existential risk.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span>Call that the &#x201C;astronomical waste&#x201D; argument.</span>\n<p>It is unclear whether premise (5) is true because it is unclear whether trying to reduce existential risk is the most effective way of maximizing humanity&#x2019;s future potential. For all we know, it could be more effective to try to create other positive trajectory changes. Clearly, it would be better to prevent extinction than to improve our social norms in a way that indirectly makes the future go one millionth better, but, in general, &#x201C;X is a bigger problem than Y&#x201D; is only a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/04/20/the-most-important-problem-may-not-be-the-best-charitable-cause/\">weak argument</a> that &#x201C;trying to address X is more important than trying to address Y.&#x201D; To be strong, the argument must be supplemented by looking at many other considerations related to X and Y, such as how much effort is going into solving X and Y, how tractable X and Y are, how much X and Y could use additional resources, and whether there are subsets of X or Y that are especially strong in terms of these considerations.</p>\n<p>Bostrom <em>does</em> have arguments that speeding up development and providing proximate benefits are not as important, in themselves, as reducing existential risk. And these arguments, I believe, have some plausibility. <strong>Since we don&#x2019;t have an argument that reducing existential risk is better than trying to create other positive trajectory changes and an existential catastrophe is one type of trajectory change, it seems more reasonable for defenders of the astronomical waste argument to focus on trajectory changes in general.</strong> It would be better to replace the last two steps of the above argument with:</p>\n<p>4&#x2019; &#xA0; Some of our actions are expected to change our development trajectory in not-ridiculously-small ways.</p>\n<p>5&#x2019;. &#xA0;If what matters most is that we maximize humanity&#x2019;s future potential and some of our actions are expected to change our development trajectory in not-ridiculously-small ways, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to change our development trajectory.</p>\n<p>6&#x2019;. &#xA0;Therefore, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to change our development trajectory.</p>\n<p>This seems to be a strictly more plausible claim than the original one, though it is less focused.</p>\n<p>In response to the arguments in this post, which I e-mailed him in advance, Bostrom wrote a reply (see the end of the post). The key comment, from my perspective, is:</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Many trajectory changes are already encompassed within the notion of an existential catastrophe. &#xA0;Becoming permanently locked into some radically suboptimal state is an xrisk. &#xA0;The notion is more useful to the extent that likely scenarios fall relatively sharply into two distinct categories---very good ones and very bad ones. &#xA0;To the extent that there is a wide range of scenarios that are roughly equally plausible and that vary continuously in the degree to which the trajectory is good, the existential risk concept will be a less useful tool for thinking about our choices. &#xA0;One would then have to resort to a more complicated calculation. &#xA0;However, extinction is quite dichotomous, and there is also a thought that many sufficiently good future civilizations would over time asymptote to the optimal track.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>I agree that a key question here is whether there is a very large range of plausible equilibria for advanced civilizations, or whether civilizations that manage to survive long enough naturally converge on something close to the best possible outcome. The more confidence one has in the second possibility, the more interesting existential risk is as a concept. The less confidence one has in the second possibility, the more interesting trajectory changes in general are. However, I would emphasize that unless we can be highly confident in the second possibility, it seems that we cannot be confident that reducing existential risk is more important than creating other positive trajectory changes because of the astronomical waste argument alone. This would turn on further considerations of the sort I described above.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Broad and narrow strategies for shaping the far future</h2>\n<p>Both the astronomical waste argument and the fixed up version of that argument conclude that what matters most is how our actions affect the far future. I am very sympathetic to this viewpoint, abstractly considered, but I think its practical implications are highly uncertain. There is a spectrum of strategies for shaping the far future that ranges from the very targeted (e.g., stop that asteroid from hitting the Earth) to very broad (e.g., create economic growth, help the poor, provide education programs for talented youth), with options like &#x201C;tell powerful people about the importance of shaping the far future&#x201D; in between. The limiting case of breadth might be just optimizing for proximate benefits or for speeding up development. Defenders of the astronomical waste argument tend to be on the highly targeted end of this spectrum. I think it&#x2019;s a very interesting question where on this spectrum we should prefer to be, other things being equal, and it&#x2019;s a topic I plan to return to in the future.</p>\n<p>The arguments I&#x2019;ve offered above favor broader strategies for shaping the far future, though they don&#x2019;t settle the issue. The main reason I say this is that <strong>the best ways of creating positive trajectory changes may be very broad and general, whereas the best ways of reducing existential risk may be more narrow and specific.</strong> For example, it may be reasonable to try to assess, in detail, questions like, &#x201C;What are the largest specific existential risks?&#x201D; and, &#x201C;What are the most effective ways of reducing those specific risks?&#x201D; In contrast, it seems less promising to try to make specific guesses about how we might create smaller positive trajectory changes because there are so many possibilities and many trajectory changes do not have significance that is predictable in advance. No one could have predicted the persistent ripple effects that Jesus&apos;s life had, for example. In other cases&#x2014;such as the framing of the US Constitution&#x2014;it&apos;s clear that a decision has trajectory change potential, but it would be hard to specify, in advance, which concrete measures should be taken. In general, it seems that the worse you are at predicting some phenomenon that is critical to your plans, the less your plans should depend on specific predictions about that phenomenon. Because of this, promising ways to create positive trajectory changes in the world may be more broad than the most promising ways of trying to reduce existential risk specifically. Improving education, improving parenting, improving science, improving our political system, spreading humanitarian values, or otherwise improving our collective wisdom as stewards of the future could, I believe, create many small, unpredictable positive trajectory changes.</p>\n<p>I do not mean to suggest that broad approaches are necessarily best, only that people interested in shaping the far future should take them more seriously than they currently do. The way I see the trade-off between highly targeted strategies and highly broad strategies is as follows. Highly targeted strategies for shaping the far future often depend on highly speculative plans, often with many steps, which are hard to execute. We often have very little sense of whether we are making valuable progress on AI risk research or geo-engineering research. On the other hand, highly broad strategies must rely on implicit assumptions about the ripple effects of doing good in more ordinary ways. It is very subtle and speculative to say how ordinary actions are related to positive trajectory changes, and estimating magnitudes seems extremely challenging. Considering these trade-offs in specific cases seems like a promising area for additional research.<strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this post, I argued that:</p><p></p><p></p><ol>\n\t<li><span>The astronomical waste argument becomes strictly more plausible if we replace the idea of minimizing existential risk with the idea of creating positive trajectory changes.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>There are many ways in which our actions could unpredictably affect our general development trajectory, and therefore many ways in which our actions could shape the far future for the better.

By contrast, broad longtermism tries to have a long-term influence by pursuing general approaches with the potential to be useful in a broader range of contexts, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/building-effective-altruism-1\">building effective altruism</a> or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-cooperation\">promoting global cooperation</a>.</p><p>Both patient and urgent longtermism, and broad and targeted longtermism, are positions that exist on a continuum. The terms \"urgent\"/\"patient\" and \"broad\"/\"targeted\" divide these continua into two discrete regions, similarly to how the terms \"tall\" and \"short\" divide the height continuum. These distinctions may thus be seen as uncovering an underlying dimension along which longtermism can vary. Accordingly, the more relevant questions are \"How patient/urgent should longtermism be?\" or \"How broad/targeted should longtermist interventions be?\", rather than \"Should longtermism be patient or urgent?\" or \"Should longtermism be targeted or narrow?\"</p><h3 id=\"Other_distinctions\">Other distinctions</h3><p>One additional distinction sometimes made—which also originates in Greaves and MacAskill—is between <i>axiological</i> and <i>deontic</i> longtermism. (\"Axiological\" and \"deontic\" are technical terms borrowed from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-philosophy\">moral philosophy</a>: \"axiological\" means \"related to what is good or valuable\" and \"deontic\" means \"related to what we ought to do or have reason to do\".) Axiological longtermism holds that positively influencing the long-term future is among the most valuable things we can do, whereas deontic longtermism holds that positively influencing the long-term future is among the things we have most reason to do. Sometimes these views are combined with strong longtermism, so axiological strong longtermism becomes the view that influencing the long-term future is the most valuable thing to do and deontic strong longtermism becomes the view that influencing the long-term future is the thing we have most reason to do.</p><p>Another relevant distinction, introduced by the philosophers Johan Gustafsson and Petra Kosonen, is between <i>normative</i> and <i>prudential</i> longtermism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9uksbqguhw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9uksbqguhw\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Normative longtermism is longtermism as it is normally understood, i.e. as a view about what is valuable, or we have reason to do, from an impersonal or moral perspective. However, one can also consider a form of longtermism focused on what is in a person's self-interest. If humans could live for thousands or millions of years, it could be argued that, even from a self-interested perspective, each person should focus primarily on the long-term effects of their actions, because a person's lifetime wellbeing will be largely determined by those effects.</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Balfour, Dylan (2021) <a href=\"https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2021/09/17/longtermism/\"><u>Longtermism: how much should we care about the far future?</u></a>, <i>1000-Word Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology</i>, September 17.</p><p>Beckstead, Nick (2019) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198841364.003.0006\">A brief argument for the overwhelming importance of shaping the far future</a>, in Hilary Greaves &amp; Theron Pummer (eds.) <i>Effective Altruism: Philosophical Issues</i>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 80–98.</p><p>MacAskill, William, Hilary Greaves &amp; Elliott Thornley (2021) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-9957281-8-9\">The moral case for long-term thinking</a>, in Natalie Cargill &amp; Tyler John (eds.) <i>The Long View: Essays on Policy, Philanthropy, and the Long-Term Future</i>, London: First, pp. 19–28.</p><p>Moorhouse, Fin (2021) <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism/\">Introduction to longtermism</a>, <i>Effective Altruism</i>, January 27.</p><p>Roser, Max (2022) <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/longtermism\"><u>The future is vast: longtermism’s perspective on humanity’s past, present, and future</u></a>, <i>Our World in Data</i>, March 15.</p><p>Todd, Benjamin (2017) <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/\"><u>Longtermism: the moral significance of future generations</u></a>, <i>80,000 Hours</i>, October.</p><p>Wikipedia (2021) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Longtermism&amp;oldid=1090541975\"><u>Longtermism</u></a>, <i>Wikipedia</i>, October 28 (updated 30 May 2022‎).</p><h2 id=\"External_links\">External links</h2><p><a href=\"https://longtermism.com/\">Longtermism</a>.

The moral costs of failing to actualize this potential thus appear to be enormous.</p><p>In relative terms, however, the costs may be quite modest. The cosmos has existed for about 10 billion years, so one should not antecedently expect cosmological processes to cause value to decay by more than 1 part in 10 billion or so per year. And the observational evidence appears to be consistent with this prior assessment. The finitude, expansion, and burndown of the universe seem all to be occurring at a slow enough rate as to be in line with the estimate based on the duration of the universe so far.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref38v46w5bueu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn38v46w5bueu\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>If the opportunity costs of delaying the exploitation of the universe's resources are so low in relative terms, however large they may be in absolute terms, it follows that such costs are unimportant relative to the costs arising from exposure to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/existential-risk\">existential risk</a>, which are much higher in comparison. Over the next decade, maybe a billionth of total attainable value will be lost as a result of failing to arrange the universe optimally. Over that same decade, perhaps a thousandth of this value will be lost in expectation from exposure to a 0.1 percent risk of an existential catastrophe. The costs from existential risk exposure thus appear to exceed the opportunity costs from delayed expansion by several orders of magnitude.</p><p>Thus, although upon first noticing the astronomical costs of delayed technological development an altruist may be tempted to conclude that such development should be hastened, that conclusion does not survive careful reflection. Because the bulk of existential risk is posed by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/anthropogenic-existential-risks\">anthropogenic existential risks</a> from new technologies, accelerating the development of new technology will itself have major effects on existential risk. Such effects will dwarf any gains from reduction of astronomical waste, and should therefore be the primary consideration for decision making.</p><h2 id=\"A_note_about_terminology\">A note about terminology</h2><p>Astronomical waste is often cited as a consideration in favor of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/longtermism\">longtermism</a>.

commonly voiced sentiment in the effective altruist community is that the best way to do the most good is generally to make as much money as possible, with a view toward donating to the most

What I write should be read as a response to the article, rather than to MacAskill&#x2019;s views.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Variance in cost-effectiveness of charities</strong></p>\n<p>MacAskill wrote</p>\n<p><em>&#x2026; charities vary tremendously in the amount of good they do with the money they receive. For example, it costs about $40,000 to train and provide a guide dog for one person, but it costs less than $25 to cure one person of sight-destroying trachoma. For the cost of improving the life of one person with blindness, you can cure 1,000 people of it&#x2026;it&#x2019;s unlikely that you can work for only the very best charities. In contrast, if you earn to give, you can donate anywhere, preferably to the most cost-effective charities, and change your donations as often as you like.</em></p>\n<p>GiveWell has spent about five years looking for the best giving opportunities in global health, and its current #1 ranked charity is <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF). GiveWell estimates that AMF <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved\">saves an infant&#x2019;s life for ~ $2,300</a>, not counting other benefits. These other benefits not withstanding, AMF&#x2019;s cost per <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/additional/DALY\">DALY saved</a> is much higher than the implied cost per DALY saved associated with the figure cited for curing sight-destroying trachoma.</p>\n<p>GiveWell may have missed giving opportunities in global health that are much more cost-effective than AMF is, but given the amount of time, energy and attention that GiveWell spent on its search, one should have a strong prior against the possibility that one can easily find a better giving opportunity in global health. So a plausible estimate of the cost-effectiveness of donating to the best charity that delivers direct global health interventions is much lower than the above quotation suggests.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the phenomenon of the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/91j7\">optimizer&#x2019;s curse</a> suggests that all charities with robust case for fairly high cost-effectiveness are closer in cost-effectiveness to AMF than explicit cost-effectiveness calculations indicate. This narrows the variance in cost-effectiveness amongst charities.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>So the advantage of being able to choose a charity to support and change at any time is smaller than the above quotation suggests.</p>\n<p><strong>Discrepancy in earnings</strong></p>\n<p>MacAskill wrote:</p>\n<p><em>Annual salaries in banking or investment start at $80,000 and grow to over $500,000 if you do well. A lifetime salary of over $10 million is typical. Careers in nonprofits start at about $40,000, and don&#x2019;t typically exceed $100,000, even for executive directors </em><span><em>... </em></span><em>By entering finance and donating 50% of your lifetime earnings, you could pay for two nonprofit workers in your place&#x2014;while still living on double what you would have if you&#x2019;d chosen that route.</em>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The assumption &#x201C;if you do well&#x201D; is a very strong one. Only about 1% of Americans make ~$500k/year. There are some people who have a strong comparative advantage in finance, for whom &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; to give may be especially compelling. But people who are able to make ~$500k/year in finance who <strong>don&#x2019;t</strong> have a large comparative advantage in finance have <strong>very strong transferable skills</strong>. Such people are significantly more capable than the average non-profit worker, and can plausibly have a bigger impact than 2 or 3 such workers by working directly on something with high social value.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Replaceability</strong></p>\n<p>MacAskill wrote:</p>\n<p><em><span>&#x2026;&#x201C;making a difference&#x201D; requires<span>&#xA0;</span></span></em><em><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice\"><span>doing something that wouldn&#x2019;t have happened</span></a><span><span>&#xA0;</span><span>anyway&#x2026;</span></span></em><em><span>The competition for not-for-profit jobs is fierce, and if someone else takes the job instead of you, he or she likely won&#x2019;t be much worse at it than you would have been. So the difference you make by taking the job is only the difference between the good you would do, and the good that the other person would have done.</span></em>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I would guess that there are some highly cost-effective humanitarian interventions that are sufficiently easy to implement that the implementers are easily replaceable. I could easily imagine that this is the case for vaccination efforts.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>But funding opportunities for these interventions can be thought of as &#x201C;low hanging fruit.&#x201D; <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">Broad market efficiency</a> suggests that such interventions will be funded. And indeed, GiveWell has found that straightforward immunization efforts <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/\">are already largely funded</a>, to the point that GiveWell has been unable to find giving opportunities for individual donors in this area.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This suggests that at the margin, <strong>very high value humanitarian efforts require highly skilled and highly motivated laborers</strong>.</p>\n<p>High skilled laborers are a relatively small subset of laborers, so there are fewer people available to do these sorts of jobs than other jobs. Doing a hard, non-routine job well requires high motivation. <span>&#xA0;</span>The collection of people who are sufficiently highly motivated to do a hard job with high social value that doesn&#x2019;t pay well, and who could otherwise be making much more money, largely consists of people who are trying to have a significant positive social impact.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>So suppose that you&#x2019;re a highly skilled laborer deciding whether to &#x201C;earn to give&#x201D; or take a job with high social value that requires high skills and motivation. If you don&#x2019;t take the job with high social value, your counterfactual replacement is likely be one of the following:<br> </p>\n<p><span><span>1.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span>Substantially less capable than you on account of having low skills, or low altruistic motivation.</p>\n<p><span><span>2.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span>A highly skilled person with high motivation, <em>who would be doing something else with high social value if you had taken the job, and who can&#x2019;t do this because they have to do the job that you would have done</em>.</p>\n<p><span><span>3.<span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </span></span></span>Nonexistent.</p>\n<p>So the replaceability consideration carries less weight than it might seem.</p>\n<p>Admittedly there&#x2019;s a counterconsideration &#x2014;&#xA0;broad market efficiency cuts both ways, and one could imagine that the low hanging fruit in <em>working directly on projects with high social valu</em>e is also plucked, and this counter-consideration pushes in favor of &#x201C;earning to give.&#x201D; I have a fairly strong intuition that &#x201C;if you don&#x2019;t fund it, somebody else will&#x201D; is more true than &#x201C;if you don&#x2019;t do it, somebody else will&#x201D; so that this counter-consideration is outweighed. It&#x2019;s important to note that many projects of high social value are the first of their kind, and that finding somebody else to execute such a project is highly nontrivial. I think that it&#x2019;s also relevant that <a href=\"http://givingpledge.org/\">114 billionaires</a> have signed the Giving Pledge, committing to giving 50+% of their wealth away in their lifetimes.<span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>In any case, there isn&#x2019;t a clear-cut, unconditional argument that favors &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D;: whether &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; is the best option very much depends on nuanced empirical considerations rather than a general abstract argument.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Other important considerations that favor an altruistic career</span></strong></p>\n<p>There are additional important considerations that favor pursuing a career with high social value over &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D;:</p>\n<p><strong>Asymmetric implications of the existence of small probability failure modes</strong>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">Robustness of Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and Philanthropy</a>, I described how a large collection of small probability failure modes conspires to substantially reduce the expected value of a funding opportunity. The same issue applies to choosing a narrow career goal with a view toward directly having a high positive social impact. But <strong>a worker has more capacity than a donor does to learn whether small probability failure modes prevail in practice, and can switch to a different job if he or she finds that such a failure mode prevails.</strong>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Here&#x2019;s an example. Suppose that you go to medical school with a view toward the possibility of performing cleft palate surgeries in the developing world. It&#x2019;s probably the case that the opportunity isn&#x2019;t as promising as it seems. But if you try it, then you&#x2019;ll be able to see how effective the intervention is firsthand. If it&#x2019;s highly effective, then you can keep doing it. If it&#x2019;s not highly effective, then you can explore other possibilities, such as&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting your own surgery organization.</li>\n<li>Switching to doing a different kind of surgery in the developing world, such as cataract removal.</li>\n<li>Working in a poor community in the developed world (which could have a bigger impact than working in the developing world owing to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>).</li>\n<li>Working for a biotech company.</li>\n<li>Getting involved in clinical medical research.</li>\n<li>Other things that haven&apos;t occurred to me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By experimenting, one can hope to hone in on a job that has both high ostensible cost-effectiveness, and and a relatively small mass of small probability failure modes.</p>\n<p><strong>Altruistic careers extend beyond the nonprofit world</strong></p>\n<p>Even on the assumption that &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; is better than working at a nonprofit, it doesn&#x2019;t follow that &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; optimizes social impact. There are ways to have a positive social impact in the for-profit world, in scientific research, and in the government.</p>\n<p><strong>Historical Precedent</strong></p>\n<p>For the most part, the people who have had the biggest positive impact on the world haven&#x2019;t had their impact by &#x201C;earning to give.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>There are a few possible exceptions, such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, whose philanthropic activities could be having a huge impact (though it&#x2019;s hard to tell from the outside) and could well outstrip the value that they contributed through their labor. But they appear to have an unusually high ratio of wealth to direct positive impact of their work, and so appear to be unrepresentative.</p>\n<p>Steve Jobs&#x2019; highest net worth was on the order of $10 billion, whereas Bill Gates&#x2019; highest net worth was on the order of $100 billion. I don&#x2019;t think that Bill Gates contributed 10x as much as Steve Jobs to technology, and I don&#x2019;t think that Jobs could have had a bigger social impact by donating than through his work (which had massive positive <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>). I acknowledge that Jobs is a cherry picked example, but I think that the general principle still holds.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Mainstream consensus</strong></p>\n<p>Few people think that &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; is the best way to make the world a better place. This could be attributable to irrationality or to low altruism, but my experience is that there are many people who care about global welfare, or just welfare within a specific cause, and many people who are highly intelligent. In light of the existence of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority\">illusory superiority</a>, one should be wary of holding an implicit view that one knows more about how to make the world a better place than the vast majority of the population.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Steelmanning wealth maximization</span></strong></p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s worth highlighting some factors that <em>favor</em> choosing a career with a view toward maximizing wealth in some situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Comparative advantage</strong> &#x2014;&#xA0;Some people are unusually good at making money relative to doing other things. Such people may do better to &#x201C;earn to give&#x201D; than to try to choose a job that has a direct positive impact (which they&#x2019;re relatively bad at).</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>The market mechanism</strong>&#xA0;&#x2014;&#xA0;In the for-profit world, maximizing wealth is often correlated with maximizing positive social impact, and so can be used as a proxy goal for maximizing positive social impact.<br><strong><br></strong></span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Connections and personal growth</strong></span>&#xA0;&#x2014; People with high earnings are generally more capable and more knowledgeable than people in other contexts, and tend to be well connected, so positioning oneself among such people can increase one&#x2019;s prospects of soaring to greater heights. Jeff Bezos <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos#Business_career\">started his career</a> in finance, and later created Amazon, which has had massive positive social impact (both direct, and via <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>).<br><strong><br></strong></li>\n<li><span><strong>Unusual values</strong></span> &#x2014;&#xA0;If one cares about causes that very few people care about, then it could be difficult to find funding for work on them, so &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; could be necessary. I don&#x2019;t believe this to be the case, but it&#x2019;s a consideration that&apos;s been raised by others, and so is worth mentioning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span>Closing summary</span></strong><strong><span>&#xA0;</span></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span>&#xAD;</span>There are many arguments against the claim that &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; is generally the best way to maximize one&#x2019;s positive social impact, and I believe that choosing a job where one can do as much good as possible through one&#x2019;s work is generally the best way to maximize one&#x2019;s positive social impact. However, for some people in unusual situations, &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D; may be the best way to have a positive social impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:<em>&#xA0;</em></strong>I formerly worked as a research analyst at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>.

For example, will you feed your son, allow him to starve so that your daughter can attend school, or take your mother to the doctor at the expense of both? The International poverty line should help us to relate to this kind of challenge. However, US$1.25 seems like an impossibly small amount of money to live on. So what can you truly buy on the international poverty line, and how is this line determined?\n</p><h2>The international poverty line is determined by the World Bank, and is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted</h2>\nIn 80% of cases, the World Bank calculates a local poverty line using the <i>cost of basic needs</i> method (1). That is, they find the price of a food bundle containing the daily energy requirement and add basic non-food expenses like access to shelter and fresh drinking water. In India, where one third of the world&#x2019;s poor live (2), this gives a poverty line of 18 Rupees (3).<p></p><p>18 Rupees are only worth 41 cents. However, as you will know if you are a traveller, this amount of money will buy more groceries in India than back home. This is why the Bank performs a PPP adjustment. Across a wide range of goods, they compare the prices of identical items in each country, in this case the US and India. Since these items cost three times as much in the US, the international poverty line is scaled up from 41c to $1.25. The groceries that you can buy for $1.25 have same value as 18 rupees of Indian groceries. So this low figure of US$1.25 is not just a trick of different purchasing powers.\n</p><h2>Living on $1.25 in the US would be hard</h2>\n$1.25 of US groceries will have <i>the same value</i> as 18 rupees of Indian groceries. However, they still may not contain enough energy. To illustrate this principle, suppose you bring $1.25 to the cheapest supermarket you can find. Even there, the rice on offer is <i>valuable</i> for its fibre content. The beans are <i>valuable </i>because they are organic. These inflate the cost of the groceries, but they don&#x2019;t help you. Your $1.25 of groceries &#x2013; luxurious though they may be &#x2013; may not meet your daily energy requirements.<p></p><p>There is no straightforward way for the World Bank to correct for the variation between these economies. The PPPs compare items from the entire cross-section of each nation&#x2019;s spending; they do not focus on the purchasing of the poorest individuals. A measure based on the consumption of the poor, called a <i>Poverty Purchasing Power Parity</i>, is very useful for comparing developing nations. However, it cannot be reliably extended to the US because no one there is poor on the global scale. &#x201C;There are n<i>o poverty line weights for the United States because no one lives at that level&#x201D;</i> (4)<i>, </i>say World Bank authors Deaton and Dupriez<i>. </i>To improve on the $1.25 figure, and truly understand poverty in terms of our own currency, we would need to start over with the cost of our basic needs.</p><p>On average, food expenses make up 56% of the international poverty line (5). &#xA0;Will this hold true for those living in the US? Well, we know from <i>Live Below the Line</i> that $1.50 of food is barely enough to survive. This could easily blow our budget. Fortunately, as Will McAskill points out, there is a robust, though unfashionable alternative (6). If we gather food discarded by retailers, a practice known as dumpster-diving, we will reduce our food expenditure to practically zero. So the availability of discarded food will redeem our rich society for its absence of cheap food!</p><p>Obtaining shelter is at least equally difficult. It will be tempting to become homeless and live under the side of a building or landscaping (7), or to become a squatter. Private homeless shelters may aid us. It may be optimal to live in a van, although if this costs two thousand dollars (8), we will have spent five years&#x2019; money at once. Maybe we could live in old cars, or share one. Maybe we ought to resell it in order to make some of our money back. Fortunately, some education and healthcare are available for free.</p><p>Living on $1.25 per day in the US may be feasible. However, as no one lives so cheaply in the US (9), it is unclear whether this is easier or harder than living on the poverty line overseas.\n</p><h2>The relative poverty line is not a better estimate</h2>\nRelative poverty is measured by taking the average or median income in a society and then halving it, or by asking people &#x201C;How much they would need to get by&#x201D;. The argument for relieving relative poverty is that relative deprivation matters to a person&#x2019;s welfare. However, though relative poverty is harmful, it is the kind of harm that is likely require larger amounts of resources to relieve. If I was asked the amount required to get by before I researched the issue myself, I would not be able to imagine how resourceful one can be if absolutely required. This will be a systematic flaw of polling people regarding poverty.<p></p><p>Consider that on a relative view, if your Body Mass Index (BMI) is less than your country&#x2019;s average, then you are <i>relatively malnourished.</i> If you buy cheaper clothes than others in your society, you are <i>relatively naked</i>. These measurements regard infer that you are poor when actually your society spends extravagantly and vainly. Here is the hard line: the American absolute poverty line is simply the international absolute poverty line, US$1.25. Although this picture is imperfect, it comes far closer to the truth than just substituting half a nation&#x2019;s median income.\n</p><h2>And what do groceries cost in Bangalore?</h2>\nAdjusting for inflation in India since the 2005 ICP, the old figure of 18 rupees can be adjusted up to 36 rupees (10). I have gathered some prices from an online shopping service based on Bangalore, to suggest what you can and can&#x2019;t afford on this budget (click to open):\n<div><p></p><p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/j4zyAeh.png\"><img alt=\"In order to register and view the prices at this website, ecityindia.com, you need only provide a valid postcode in Bangalore\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j4zyAeh.png\"></a><br>Online shops target richer than average Indian consumers, and there are likely to be better deals elsewhere. On the other hand, remember to save some of your 36 rupees for expenses other than groceries!\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\nSo $1.25 per day of your funds may not be enough to live in America. However, 41 cents is enough to live elsewhere. Now might be a good time to reevaluate your sense of privilege!<p></p><p>At little cost, you can help others a lot.

People compare themselves favorably or unfavorably to others in their social circles based on their wealth and their earning power, and signals thereof, and compare their social circles favorably or unfavorably with other social circles based on the average wealth of people in the social circles. Humans crave social status, and this is one of people&#x2019;s motivations for making money.</p>\n<p>Effective altruists attempt to quantify &#x201C;amount of good done&#x201D; and maximize it. Once this framing is adopted, &#x201C;amount of good done&#x201D; becomes a measure of social status in the same way that money is. Most people who aspire to be effective altruists will be partially motivated by a desire to matter more than other people, in the sense of doing more good. People who join the effective altruism movement may do so partially out of a desire to matter more than people who are not in the movement.</p>\n<p>Harnessing status motivations for the sake of doing the most good can have profound positive impacts. But under this paradigm, <em>effective altruists will generally be motivated to believe that they&#x2019;re doing more good than other people are</em>. This motivation is not necessarily dominant in any given case, but it&#x2019;s sufficiently strong to be worth highlighting.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, note that <em>effective altruists will be motivated to believe that the activities that they themselves are capable of engaging in have higher value than they actually do, and that activities that others are engaged in have lower value than they actually do. Without effort to counterbalance this motivation, effective altruists&#x2019; views of the philanthropic landscape will be distorted, and they&#x2019;ll be apt to bias others in favor of the areas that use their own core competencies.</em></p>\n<p>I worry that the effective altruist community hasn&#x2019;t taken sufficient measures to guard against this issue. In particular, I&#x2019;m not aware of any overt public discussion of it. Independently of whether or not there are examples of public discussion that I&#x2019;m unaware of, the fact that I&#x2019;m not aware of any suggests that any discussion that has occurred hasn&#x2019;t percolated enough.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll refrain from giving specific examples that I see as causes for concern, on account of political sensitivity. The effective altruist community is divided into factions, and <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/\">Politics is the Mind-Killer</a>. I believe that there are examples of each faction irrationally overestimating the value of their activities, and/or irrationally undervaluing the value of other faction&apos;s activities, and I believe that in each case, motivated reasoning of the above type may play a role.</p>\n<p><strong>I request that commenters not discuss particular instances in which they believe that this has occurred, or is occurring, as I think that such discussion would reduce collaboration between different factions of the effective altruist community.</strong></p>\n<p>The effective altruist movement is in early stages, and it&#x2019;s important to arrive at accurate conclusions about effective philanthropy <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration\">as fast as possible</a>. At this stage in time, it may be that the biggest contribution that members of the community can make is to engender and engage in an honest and unbiased discussion of how best to make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t have a very definite proposal for how this can be accomplished. I welcome any suggestions. For now, I would encourage effective altruist types to take pride in being <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/dyk/selfskepticism_the_first_principle_of_rationality/\">self-skeptical</a>&#xA0;when it comes to favorable assessments of their potential impact relative to other effective altruist types, or relative to people outside of the effective altruist community.</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements: </strong> Thanks to Vipul Naik and Nick Beckstead for feedback on an earlier draft of this post..</p><p></p><p></p></div>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>I formerly worked as a research analyst at GiveWell.

This article in particular also has a very interesting new feature: a large comments section full of people who don&#x2019;t already agree with us.</p>\n<p>The level of discourse there is pretty low, but if we want the ideas behind effective altruism to spread thoroughly, they have to be able to survive in that kind of environment. So I decided it might be instructive to hold my nose, read the comments section and try to draw lessons about how we can refine our ideas for a wider audience.</p>\n<p>Reading through the negative responses, there are roughly five principal components of the objections. Some combination of these components accounted for all the attacks against earning to give that I saw (I read through the whole thread up to 12 PM on June 1st, although my eyes may have glazed over a couple of times). So here are the five main strains:</p>\n<h2>You&#x2019;re supporting the system!</h2>\n<p>One common response is that it&#x2019;s still not OK to participate in the Wall Street &#x201C;system&#x201D;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you make commodities more expensive through trading and excessive speculation, than donate your a portion of your profits to starving people, it&#x2019;s a bit disingenuous, because you are part of the reason that the price of their food is beyond their reach. &#x2014;<strong>mhdrgdajveeah</strong></p>\n<p>Nonsense. Wall Street is ruining this country. Dirty, rotten, greedy scum. All of them. So what if they give away some of their money. How about the hard working people who have been ruined by Wall Street? &#x2014;<strong>dubhlaoich</strong></p>\n<p>The problem you run into &#x2014; </p>\n<p>If you are making the money by financing a company that is doing more harm than you can possibly do good from your profit. </p>\n<p>For instance a company may want to exploit emerging markets for tobacco products. &#x2014;<strong>Mark in Colorado</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These kind of retorts are why it&#x2019;s <em>very important</em> to mention <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1\">replaceability</a>: that if you don&#x2019;t work in an unethical industry, someone else will take your place. For a lot of people, after they hear the replaceability argument, it seems so obvious in retrospect that they don&#x2019;t mention it except as a counter-argument when they realize that other people haven&#x2019;t figured it out.</p>\n<p>But in fact, it seems replaceability (and more generally, thinking about marginal, rather than total, effects) is highly non-obvious to most people. So I think we need to talk about replaceability a lot more, especially in mainstream sources.</p>\n<h2>What about big problem <em>x</em>?</h2>\n<p>This type of comment complains that those who are earning to give should be working on some piece of a bigger problem. In this case the main target is &#x201C;fixing the system&#x201D;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I suppose that&#x2019;s noble to play against the greedy at their own game, but I&#x2019;d rather see the &#x2018;game&#x2019; simply not exist. Or how about simply assessing a fair tax rate on trades, to support our government&#x2019;s efforts to eradicate malaria, among many other things? &#x2014;<strong>naomi94112</strong></p>\n<p>and, just what ecocide is being supported or expanded by the companies whose stocks are being blindly manipulated for profit? Wouldn&#x2019;t it be better to attempt to truly change the world by changing US policy toward the environment, for example? &#x2014;<strong>getsmart4</strong></p>\n<p>We need the smart, dedicated people who want to do the right thing to put their energies and talents directly into reforming a system that is dragging people down, or at least not enabling it. &#x2014;<strong>jgunne</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We need to emphasize more that <em>we care about these problems, we just can&#x2019;t do much about them.</em> Take financial reform. The financial industry currently records profits of about $120 billion a year (<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/03/30/chart-of-the-day-us-financial-profits/\">source</a>). If proposed reforms halve those profits, the industry should be willing to spend up to $60 billion a year on lobbying to prevent such reform, which means we&#x2019;d need to muster the same kind of resources to pass such reform. That&#x2019;s about the total estimated cost of curing malaria by 2020 (<a href=\"http://www.rbm.who.int/gmap/2-5.html\">source</a>), every year. So just because something is a big problem, doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s the best problem to work on.</p>\n<h2>You should attack the causes, not the symptoms.</h2>\n<p>Another common argument is that solving disease is curing a symptom, not a cause.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve nothing against charity, but the belief that this sort of charity will &#x201C;save the world&#x201D; is naive and ignores the structural conditions that perpetuate poverty. So long as property and wealth continues to be concentrated in a small number of hands &#x2014; Wall Street being emblematic of this &#x2014; there will continue to be those deprived of the basic necessities of life. &#x2014;<strong>GeorgeStevens</strong></p>\n<p>I do find this talk about saving lives curiously bloodless. It&#x2019;s a little like pro-lifers forcing women to give birth to their fetuses, only for them (the pro-lifers) to walk away from the resulting infant and call back to them, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re on your own now!&#x201D; These do-gooders are just kicking the can a little further down the road. &#x2014;<strong>barnesgene</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t know too much about development economics, but I think there&#x2019;s a fairly clear response here: it&#x2019;s not a cause/symptom relationship, it&#x2019;s a vicious cycle. Poor countries have no health infrstructure, so they have high disease burd en, so they&#x2019;re economically disadvantaged, so they can&#x2019;t build health infrastructure. Attacking any portion of the loop is helpful, and disease happens to be the easiest to solve from outside.</p>\n<h2>But we can&#x2019;t ever <em>know</em> how much good we&#x2019;re doing!</h2>\n<p>The trend that is most annoying to me personally is the insistence that since we don&#x2019;t know things for sure, we shouldn&#x2019;t do anything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it really ethical (or smart) to fund mosquito nets in lieu of a seeing eye dog on the premise that thousands of nets can be bought for one dog? Can they really know per-emptively [sic] the value will come from the distribution of those nets versus the placement of one service dog? And if they do know, what are the criteria that they use to justify their decision? Is it reasonable to assume that mosquito netting will make a contribution to African society in way that one seeing eye dog cannot make too somebody in this country? &#x2014;<strong>cleverrevolution</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of the comments stem from the ultimate problem with the sort of Utilitarian arguments Singer presents. Because of the incredible complexity of the world and the actions of our consequences, attempts to treat the maximization of minimal global goods often end in absurdity or obscurity. Which action, given the infinitude of unforeseeable consequences of any action, will maximize goods? Unfortunately, much more difficult to say than just &#x2018;save this girl!&#x2019; Then, how far do you go? The best objection I&#x2019;ve seen in this vane is Parfit&#x2019;s repugnant conclusion. For those interested: <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/\">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclu&#x2026;</a> &#x2014;<strong>Calicles</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not an accident that the only objecter actually to engage with philosophy fell under this category: the counter-argument is a bit more nuanced and difficult to explain. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to boil it down into a form that can survive and replicate in a comment thread&#x2014;though I think it&#x2019;s pretty important that we figure something out.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the basic form of the counter-argument is that, sure, we don&#x2019;t know what the end result will be, but we can make a really good guess. Good enough that using such estimates gets way, way better results than doing what feels intuitively right, or whatever other rule you&#x2019;re picking actions by. I&#x2019;ve been reading a lot of Slate Star Codex recently, so I&#x2019;ll refer interested readers to <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/\">Scott Alexander</a> for a more detailed analysis of this problem.</p>\n<h2>But deontology/virtue ethics!</h2>\n<p>Possibly the most important thing we can learn from these comments is that lots of people just aren&#x2019;t consequentialists&#x2014;not even because of philosophical objections like Calicles, but because the default morality that most people grow up with isn&#x2019;t consequentialism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t know anything about hedge funds but isn&#x2019;t that generally unethical?? \nThe ends do not justify the means. &#x2014;<strong>GerriM</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, please. Saving the world is Jesus&#x2019; job. Working on Wall Street makes you a financial industry employee, not a savior of anything. If you want to do the world some good, then act like a man. Remember manhood? Remember value? Remember not speculating and gambling, but building and constructing? Stop ripping people off with fake math. Call it like it is.  </p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not the money, but the merit, that gives a man the glow of sunshine. </p>\n<p>Figure it out, kid. &#x2014;<strong>agx48</strong></p>\n<p>Trigg&#x2019;s mistake is dicounting the human element that makes his money able to do something. Without the human element the money doesn&#x2019;t make a difference. Such a petulant child. &#x2014;<strong>Frazil</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this might be the most important objection to get better at answering&#x2014;not only to get people to accept earning to give, but to raise the sanity waterline more generally. I hope to touch more on what exactly is going on with these commenters in a future post. But the upshot is that making consequentialism more viscerally appealing to people is a really important thing to do.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is only intended to be one step in the process of responding to mainstream views of earning to give. I don&#x2019;t have very many thoughts yet about how to make effective-altruism memes more resilient to objections like these. I mostly just want to do the legwork of categorizing the most common objections, so that more skilled rhetoricians than I can figure out how to spread memes that answer them.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections\">Ben Kuhn&apos;s blog</a></em>\n</p>\n</div></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"pg5MHgnpDWnnWDTyY":2,"sSZ8pCvackwaY9vBx":2},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":1,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.00000419081821315484,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-16T01:59:13.259Z","name":"Earning to give","slug":"earning-to-give","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Earning to give</strong> is the pursuit of a lucrative career with the purpose of donating a significant portion of the earnings to cost-effective organizations.</p><p>The value of earning to give may not be immediately obvious, since people tend to think of ethical jobs as those with a <i>direct</i> positive impact.

the coming weeks, I intend to write up a history of the different parts of the effective altruist movement and their interrelations. It&#x2019;s natural to start with the part that I know best: the history of my own involvement with effective altruism.</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h2>Interest in altruism rooted in literature</h2>\n<p>My interest in altruism traces to early childhood. Unbeknownst to me, my verbal comprehension ability was unusually high relative to my other cognitive abilities, and for this reason, I gravitated strongly toward reading. Starting from the age of six, I spent hours a day reading fiction. I found many of the stories that I read to be emotionally compelling, and identified with the characters.</p>\n<p>My interest is altruism is largely <em>literary</em> in origin &#x2014; I perceive the sweep of history to be a story, and I want things to go well for the characters, and want the story to have a happy ending. I was influenced both by portrayals of sympathetic, poor characters in need, and by stories of the triumph of the human spirit, and I wanted to help the downtrodden, and contribute to the formation of peak positive human experiences.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I sometimes wonder whether there are other people with altruistic tendencies that are literary in origin, and whether they would be good candidate members of the effective altruist movement. There is some history of artists having altruistic goals. The great painter Vincent van Gogh moved to an impoverished coal mine to <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/vincent-van-gogh-9515695\">preach and minister to the sick</a>. The great mathematician Alexander Grothendieck gave <a href=\"http://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf\">shelter to the homeless</a>.</p>\n<h2>An analytical bent, and utilitarianism</h2>\n<p>When I was young, I had vague and dreamy hopes about how I might make the world a better place. As I grew older, I found myself more focused on careful reasoning and rationality.</p>\n<p>In high school, I met <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/06/03/my-donation-for-2009-guest-post-from-dario-amodei/\">Dario Amodei</a>, who introduced me to utilitarianism. The ethical framework immediately resonated with me. For me, it corresponded to valuing the well being of all characters in the story &#x2014; a manifestation of <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2013/01/mr-rogers-on-unconditional-love.html\">universal love</a>.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of my interest in maximizing aggregated global welfare. Maximizing aggregated global welfare corresponds to maximizing cost-effectiveness, and so this can be thought of as the origin of my interest in <em>effective</em> altruism.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I believe that I would have developed interest in global welfare, and in effective altruism, on my own accord, without encountering any members of the effective altruist movement. But for reasons that I describe below, if not for meeting these people, I don&#x2019;t think that my interests would have been actionable.</p>\n<h2>Epistemic paralysis</h2>\n<p>My analytical bent had a downside.</p>\n<p>Issues pertaining to the human world are very complex, and there aren&#x2019;t clear-cut objective answers to the question of how best to make the world a better place. On a given issue, there are many arguments for a given position, and many counterarguments to the arguments, and many counterarguments to the counterarguments, and so on.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Contemplating these resulted in my falling into a state of <a href=\"http://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html\">epistemic learned helplessness</a>. I became convinced that it&apos;s not possible to rationally develop confidence in views concerning how to make the world a better place.</p>\n<h2>Enter GiveWell</h2>\n<p>In 2007, my college friend <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/116-interview-with-brian-tomasik\">Brian Tomasik</a> pointed me to GiveWell. At the time, GiveWell had just launched, and there wasn&#x2019;t very much on the website, so I soon forgot about it.</p>\n<p>In 2009, my high school friend Dario, who had introduced me to utilitarianism, pointed me to GiveWell again. By this point, there was much more information available on the GiveWell website.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I began following GiveWell closely. I was very impressed by the fact that co-founders Holden and Elie seemed to be making sense of the ambiguous world of effective philanthropy. I hadn&#x2019;t thought that it was possible to reason so well about the human world. This made effective altruism more credible in my eyes, and inspired me. If hadn&#x2019;t encountered GiveWell, I may not have gotten involved with the effective philanthropy movement at all, although I may have become involved through interactions of Less Wrong, and I may have gone on to do socially valuable work in <a href=\"http://www.mathisbeauty.org\">math education</a>.</p>\n<p>I became progressively more impressed by GiveWell over time, and wanted to become involved. In 2011, I did volunteer work for GiveWell, and in 2012, I began working at GiveWell as a research analyst.</p>\n<p>While working at GiveWell, I learned a great deal about how to think about philanthropy, and about epistemology more generally. A crucial development in my thinking was the gradual realization that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost-effectiveness estimates that are supported by a single line of evidence are unreliable.</li>\n<li>Investigation generally reveals that interventions that appear highly cost-effective relative to other interventions are often much worse (in a relative sense) than one would initially guess.</li>\n<li>One can become much more confident in one&#x2019;s assessment of the value of a philanthropic intervention by <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/10/maximizing-cost-effectiveness-via-critical-inquiry/\">examining it from many different angles</a>.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wrote about this realization in my post <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">Robustness of Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and Philanthropy</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This shift in my thinking gradually percolated, and I realized that my entire epistemological framework had been seriously flawed, because <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hmb/many_weak_arguments_vs_one_relatively_strong/\">I was relying too much on a small number of relatively strong arguments rather than a large number of independent weak arguments</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Many people had tried to explain this to me in the past, but I was unable to understand what they were driving at, and it was only through my work at GiveWell and my interactions with my coworkers that I was finally able to understand. The benefits of this realization have spanned many aspects of my life, and have substantially increased my altruistic human capital.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If GiveWell hadn&#x2019;t existed, it&#x2019;s very possible that I wouldn&#x2019;t have learned these things. If Dario hadn&#x2019;t pointed me to GiveWell, I&#x2019;m sure that I would have encountered GiveWell eventually, but it may have been too late for it to be possible for me to work there, and so I may not have had the associated learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>My involvement with GiveWell also facilitated my meeting <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/05/guest-post-from-vipul-naik/\">Vipul Naik</a>, the founder of <a href=\"http://openborders.info/\">Open Borders</a>. We&#x2019;ve had many fruitful interactions related to maximizing global welfare, and if I hadn&#x2019;t met him through GiveWell, it may have been years before we met.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The significance of Less Wrong</h2>\n<p>Several people pointed me to Overcoming Bias and <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com\">Less Wrong</a> starting in 2008, but at the time the posts didn&#x2019;t draw me in relative to the fascination of <a href=\"http://www.mathisbeauty.org/preludereciprocitylaws.pdf\">reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory</a>. In early 2010, Brian Tomasik pointed me to some of <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/6ga/index_of_yvains_excellent_articles/\">Yvain&#x2019;s articles</a> on Less Wrong. With the background context of me following GiveWell, Yvain&#x2019;s posts on utilitarianism really resonated with me. So I started reading Less Wrong.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I met many impressive people who are seriously interested in effective altruism through Less Wrong. Among these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/\">Nick Beckstead</a> &#x2014; A new postdoc at Oxford University (specifically, the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a>) who wrote the thesis <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research\">On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/user/paulfchristiano/overview/\">Paul Christiano</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/user/jsteinhardt/overview/\">Jacob Steinhardt</a> &#x2014; graduate students in theory of computing and machine learning at Berkeley and Stanford (respectively). Jacob is a <a href=\"http://www.hertzfoundation.org/dx/fellows/fellow_profile.aspx?d=1205\">Hertz Fellow</a>, and Paul coauthored a 48 page paper titled <a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740\">Quantum Money from Hidden Subspaces</a> as an undergraduate. Paul <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">has thought a great deal about rational altruism,</a> and Jacob is a member of <a href=\"http://www.vannevargroup.org/\">The Vannevar Group</a>, which aims to accelerate scientific progress to create the greatest amount of social good.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://math.berkeley.edu/~qchu/\">Qiaochu Yuan</a> &#x2014; A math graduate student at Berkeley who has the <a href=\"http://mathoverflow.net/users/290/qiaochu-yuan\">sixth highest karma score on MathOverflow</a>. I&#x2019;ve been enjoying learning math from Qiaochu.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/user/CarlShulman/overview/\">Carl Shulman</a> and <a href=\"http://rationality.org/about/\">Dan Keys</a>. I&#x2019;ve found very intellectually stimulating and have learned a great deal from them.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lukeprog.com/\">Luke Muehlhauser</a> &#x2014; The executive director of MIRI.</li>\n<li>Others &#x2014; Including Julia Galef, Anna Salamon, Katja Grace, Louie Helm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They&#x2019;ve helped me retain my motivation to do the most good, and have aided me in thinking about effective altruism. They constitute a substantial chunk of the most impressive people who I know in my age group.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s genuinely unclear whether I would have gotten to know these people if Eliezer hadn&#x2019;t started Less Wrong.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Closing summary</h2>\n<p>My innate inclinations got me interested in effective altruism, but they probably wouldn&#x2019;t have sufficed for my interest to be actionable. Beyond my innate inclinations, the things that stand out most in my mind as having been crucial are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dario introducing me to GiveWell</li>\n<li>Working at GiveWell</li>\n<li>Meeting Vipul through GiveWell</li>\n<li>Eliezer starting Less Wrong</li>\n<li>Meeting peers through Less Wrong</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working at GiveWell substantially increased my altruistic human capital. I&#x2019;ve learned a great deal from the GiveWell staff, from Vipul, and from the members of the Less Wrong community listed above. We&#x2019;ve had fruitful collaborations, and they&#x2019;ve helped me retain my motivation to do the most good.</p>\n<p>The personal growth benefits that I derived from working at GiveWell are unusual, if only because GiveWell&#x2019;s staff is small. The networking benefits from Less Wrong are shared by many others.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I formerly worked as a research analyst at GiveWell.

But for now, I think there is a much more compelling reason to save: there is a very good chance that the best giving opportunities we can identify in the near future will be better than the best giving opportunities we can identify this year.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>The basic reason for optimism is that only a very small fraction of all existing charitable opportunities&#x2014;much less all possible altruistic interventions&#x2014;have been rigorously assessed. Activities like political advocacy and differential tech development seem like they could easily have very large impacts, but at the moment those impacts are poorly understood. So today we have a choice between focusing on relatively simple, well-understood interventions, or going out on a limb and supporting more speculative work.</p>\n<p>The speculative projects seem like they probably have much larger impact, but speculative projects probably vary greatly in their cost-effectiveness in ways we don&#x2019;t yet understand: in those areas we do understand, we observe large gaps between the most and least effective interventions which are often hard to notice without more detailed analysis, and it seems likely that similar gaps will exist in harder-to-quantify areas. So at the moment it seems like we will be able to do much more with our money in the future.</p>\n<p>This situation should be familiar to many donors, and especially to &#x201C;effective altruists&#x201D;: our <em>current</em> best guesses (in most cases) are not only different from our past best guesses, they are also likely to be several times more cost-effective.</p>\n<p>There are many positive effects from giving now, via enhancing the credibility and coherence of effective altruism (EA) as a movement, increasing the reach of effective altruist organizations. My current view is that the gains to giving now are significant and in many cases dominate the direct impacts; however, because the cost of giving large amounts now is so high it is very valuable to explore alternatives that can produce similar amounts of value without being so wasteful. I suspect that appropriate arrangements involving large EA donor-advised funds would be able to capture many of these gains.</p>\n<p>An even more important consideration is that if we all stopped giving we would mostly stop learning as well&#x2014;most things we learn comes from our current activities, rather than the passage of time itself. However, a small fraction of activities today seem to be responsible for much of the learning, and so I believe that the great majority of giving by effective altruists could be better spent either on activities better designed to help learn or on saving for the future. If learning is the main goal of giving, then you should be engaged in a different kind of cost-benefit analysis, and you are much more likely to support research and exploratory projects than scaling up proven health interventions (though there are also challenges to scaling up proven interventions which are important to learn more about).</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m not going to lay out the case for giving later in great detail here, because I think most readers will already believe it. Instead I will look at the most compelling reasons to give now anyway, and explain my response to these considerations.</p>\n<h2>The credibility of the effective altruism movement depends on giving now</h2>\n<p>Through the growth of organizations like GiveWell, 80.000 hours, and Giving What We Can, it is clear that there is a growing contingent of donors who are willing to direct their donations according to considerations of effectiveness. The fact that the community actually does donate is important, for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It increases the credibility, coherence, and influence of the community itself. I have only a weak idea of what it means to be a &#x201C;rationalist,&#x201D; but donating significant amounts to cost-effective charities is a costly signal of &#x201C;effective altruism.&#x201D; It grounds the community and reduces the probability that it will lose its focus or direction. Moreover, it significantly increases the external credibility of the movement and makes participation more respectable and attractive. It also increases the persuasiveness of the movement&#x2019;s ideas, and the ability of people within the movement to influence funders.</li>\n<li>It increases the access of effective altruists to charities. If GiveWell moved $100,000 a year, few charities would want to deal with them or go through the effort to become extremely transparent about their own effectiveness (unless they were intrinsically motivated to do so). If GiveWell moves $10M a year, the situation is different.</li>\n<li>It increases the perceived demand for effective charities. Some causes may be particularly interesting to effective altruists while being relatively unattractive to normal donors. Those causes face a chicken-and-egg problem: until charities are doing work on them there is little evidence for their impact and so EAs don&#x2019;t want to donate, and until EAs are donating to those causes or similar ones, would-be charities are discouraged by the lack of available funding and so must court a more mainstream audience. If the effective altruism movement is currently directing millions of dollars to our current best guesses and being transparent about what exactly they are looking for, this may help us get out of the chicken-and-egg situation by making it clear there is a large pot of money which is supporting the most demonstrably-cost effective interventions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think each of these considerations is significant on its own, and taken together they are definitely a big deal. But I am not convinced that giving now is necessary in order to realize these benefits. In particular, I think that an appropriately organized donor-advised fund (DAF) could capture many or most of them. Giving to a charity that is 1/10 as effective as what you expect to find in 10 years is only marginally better than wasting money altogether, and so it seems like a relatively high priority to figure out how to capture these benefits while giving later.</p>\n<p>There are a number of ways that EA DAFs might be organized; here are three that seem to me like they might be able to capture a significant fraction of the total value of giving now:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Directly under the control of EA organizations, such as GiveWell or Giving What We Can, which have missions statements and track records that make it clear that they will give to demonstrably cost-effective charities.</li>\n<li>Under the supervision and perhaps nominal control of EA organizations, such that grant-making is still at donor&#x2019;s discretion but there is moderate social and logistical pressure to make donations to demonstrably cost-effective charities (particularly those which receive broad support within the EA community, or those backed by strong cost-effectiveness estimates)</li>\n<li>Under the control of individual donors, but (1) loosely affiliated with the EA community via some explicit arrangement such as pledging or registering, and (2) periodically making small grants which indicate the nature of the donor&#x2019;s interests.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Effect on credibility, coherence, etc. of the EA movement: </strong>Any of these options would probably work to increase the coherence of effective altruism (and establish habits of giving, signal commitment to altruism, etc.) There are disadvantages to such indirect schemes, but if anything a large community of donors publicly setting up donor-advised funds and investing in the search for more cost-effective giving appears to be <em>more</em> distinctive (and more easily justified) than a community giving to their current best guesses. In terms of appeal to normal folk who might consider affiliating with the EA movement, giving later appeals to a very different audience than giving to the developing world now (which is smaller but more likely to pursue higher-impact interventions discovered down the line). Depending on which of these audiences is more valuable, the difference could be a significant cost to completely switching from giving now to giving later. But I think that at a minimum redirecting a large share of funding to giving later would make the movement attractive to a broader range of people.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect on EA organizations: </strong>These options have quite different effects on the influence and prestige of effective altruist organizations. Option 1 may well have a larger positive impact than recommendation-based giving. Option 2 seems to be more nebulous, and I don&#x2019;t know whether the effect would be larger or smaller (it would probably be sensitive to details of the arrangement). Option 3 would have a smaller impact on the credibility of EA organizations; it would be significantly larger than the effect of e.g. pledges for <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us\">Giving What We Can</a>, but probably significantly smaller than the impact of actual donations. Funds which are publicly committed to the recommendations of a particular organization might have a large effect on that organization&#x2019;s credibility, but if the commitment is over a longer timescale than most fundraising charities are concerned with (which seems to be relatively short) then this effect would be muted.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect on perceived demand for effective charities: </strong>If relatively well-planned and backed by a larger effective altruism movement, I think that any of these proposals would have a large effect on the perceived demand for efficient charities. As above, the primary difficulty is that funders might be willing to let funds sit for decades, while fundraisers are not really concerned with the demand for effective charities in 20 years. For charities which are not plausibly top recommendations for effective altruists this may not be a huge deal; the biggest concern is if there is ambiguity over whether <em>any</em> opportunity could earn this designation in a realistic timeframe. Periodic small grants would help this issue somewhat,</p>\n<h2>Learning depends on giving now</h2>\n<p>I think the most important impact of giving now is probably that it accelerates the process of learning. At the level of the EA movement, the main reason to be optimistic about better giving opportunities emerging in the future is that we will actively seek out such opportunities, and discover through experience what directions are most fruitful to explore. (As an individual you can expect your money to go further if you wait and do nothing, but only because you can benefit from the work of others.)</p>\n<p>However, I think that <em>most</em> causes that EAs currently donate to are not responsible for this learning, except indirectly for the reasons explored in the last section (e.g., giving to AMF is not a cost-effective way of learning in and of itself, but may facilitate GiveWell&#x2019;s other activities, which <em>are</em> a big driver of current learning). A relatively small set of activities seems to be responsible for most learning that is occurring (for example, much of GiveWell&#x2019;s work, some work within the <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, some strategy work within <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a>, hopefully parts of this blog, and a great number of other activities that can&#x2019;t be so easily sliced up). The argument I&#x2019;ve given definitely <em>doesn&#x2019;t</em> justify delaying any of this funding: I&#x2019;m recommending delaying object-level do-gooding <em>relative</em> to learning, not delaying do-gooding altogether.</p>\n<p>However, it may be that some of these activities produce info much more efficiently than others, and depending on the relative importance of funding and haste it may be worthwhile to stall some of these activities while the most important info-gathering proceeds. To me it currently looks like the value of getting information faster is significantly higher than the value of money, and on the current margin I think most of these learning activities are underfunded. A more serious concern is that there seems to currently be a significant deficit of human capital specialized for this problem and willing to work on it (without already being committed to work on it), so barring some new recruitment strategies (e.g. paying market wages for non-EAs to do EA strategy research) there are significant issues with room for more funding.</p>\n<p>These issues seem important to me, and I&#x2019;ll certainly return to them in future posts. For now, I&#x2019;d leave it at: a small fraction of activities EAs fund are directly producing relevant info, and those are probably important and worth scaling up. However, the majority of EA funding does not fall into this category.</p>\n<h2>Some activities have very high returns</h2>\n<p>The final compelling reason to fund work now, despite expecting better interventions to be available in the future, is that some activities have very high rates of return. In general I am <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/03/12/giving-now-vs-later/\">quite skeptical</a> about most such claims. But I know of two plausible cases for interventions that have high enough discount rates to justify early spending (I have looked at many other possibilities but haven&#x2019;t conducted an exhaustive inquiry):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Outreach and movement building</strong>. See <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80.000 Hours</a>, and the <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>. It seems plausible that investments in outreach can speed up the growth of some of these movements, hastening the point where they are saturated in the population. If these movements are currently quite small compared to their long-term potential, such speed-ups could result in large multipliers on effort invested today. Moreover, these movements might produce human and financial capital which can be used in the medium-term for learning. So even if the returns to these interventions are only severalfold, they could still be justified as an indirect way of learning more. My main concern with movement building is that the communities they produce may end up not be useful for exploring new interventions, either because the values or intellectual standards of these communities decline, because they irrevocably specialize in order to grow, or because they are not able to inspire very many strong researchers who would not otherwise have been interested.<i><br>\n</i></li>\n<li><strong>Research on impacts of artificial intelligence</strong>. See <a href=\"http://intelligence.org\">MIRI</a>. It looks like a transition to machine intelligence will very likely occur sometime in the next few centuries, and the transition itself may be quite disruptive. I think there is room for valuable work understanding what such a transition might look like and understanding how to influence it. Because there is a modest probability of a surprising transition relatively soon, it might be worth engaging in this project now even without a reliable estimate of its impact. This is especially true if we expect philanthropists of 30 years from now to more reliably pursue high-impact interventions, so that there will be fewer good opportunities in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although both of these activities could have very high returns and so could in principle be worth supporting <em>instead</em> of learning more, I don&#x2019;t think this is a realistic position. Instead, I consider [1] a potentially efficient way to accelerate learning, and expect that most of the value from movement building comes from the possibility of setting up a community which can learn much faster. I think the most valuable parts of [2] are targeted strategy work which will shed light on the overall landscape and help us learn whether it is worth investing much more heavily in research on AI impacts. That is, although in both of these cases there is potentially high-impact object-level work, there are analogous high-impact approaches to learning, and so that remains the most important output.</p>\n\n<em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/10/the-best-reason-to-give-later/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"FBTCnrdQp9aDa6AJ3":2,"juaPApskvgnvhqxbj":2},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":2,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000081,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-12-28T14:23:35.786Z","name":"Timing of philanthropy","slug":"timing-of-philanthropy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>timing of philanthropy</strong> is the selection of the optimal schedule for philanthropic donations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/investing\">investing</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/patient-altruism\">patient altruism</a></p>\n","postCount":54,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"FBTCnrdQp9aDa6AJ3"}]},{"_id":"GE2yRLTYCkcRCSctv","postedAt":"2013-06-17T04:00:42.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Using time effectively as a student","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2017-01-10T20:24:14.797Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GE2yRLTYCkcRCSctv/using-time-effectively-as-a-student","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>When I was at college, many of my associates had part time jobs, or worked during school breaks. The jobs were often unpleasant, uninspiring, and poorly paid ones, such as food preparation. Some were better, such as bureaucracy. But they were generally much worse than any of the jobs we would expect to have after graduating. I think this is normal.</p><p>It was occasionally suggested that I too should become employed. This seemed false to me, for the following reasons. There are other activities I want to spend a lot of time on in my life, such as thinking about how to make the world better. I expect the nth hour of thinking to be roughly as valuable regardless of when it happens. If I think for a hundred extra hours this year, or a hundred extra hours in five years, I still expect to have about the same amount of understanding at the end, and for hours in ten years to be about as valuable either way.</p><p>Depending on what one is thinking about, moving hours of thinking earlier might make them more valuable. Understanding things early on probably adds value to other activities, and youth is purportedly a bit helpful for thinking. Also a better understanding early on probably makes later observations (which automatically happen with passing time) more useful.</p><p>This goes for many things. Reading, learning various skills, writing. Some things are arguably even more valuable early on in life, such as making friends, gaining respect, and figuring out efficient lifestyle logistics.</p><p>Across many periods of time, work is roughly like this. It is the total amount of work you do that matters. But between before and after graduating, this is not so! An hour of work is worth a lot more to you after you can get a well paid and highly productive job.</p><p>Suppose I want to do some of activity A and some of activity B. If activity A is a lot more valuable in the future, and activity B is about as valuable now or in the future, all things equal I should trade them and do B now, if I can.</p><p>One might retort that work before graduating will get you a better wage after graduating. However, so will the same amount of work after graduating, and it will be paid more at the time. Yes, you will be a year behind say, but you will have done something else for a year that you no longer need to do in the future.</p><p>Work makes a lot of sense if you have pressing needs for money now and no ability to borrow, or a strong aversion to indebtedness. My guess is that the latter played a large part in others&#x2019; choices. When I was at school in Australia, most youth whose families weren&apos;t wealthy could get enough money to live on from the government, and anyone could defer paying tuition until they had a good income later.</p><p>It seems that college students generally treat their time as low value. Not only do they work for low wages, but they go to efforts to get free food, and are happy to spend an hour of three people&#x2019;s time to acquire discarded furniture they wouldn&#x2019;t spend a hundred dollars on. This seems to mean they don&#x2019;t think these activities they could do at any time in their life are valuable. If you are willing to trade an hour you could be reading for $10 worth of value, you don&#x2019;t value reading much. When these people are paid a lot more, will they give up activities like reading all together? If not, it seems they think reading is also more valuable in the future than now, and the relative values are jumping roughly in line with the value of working at these times. Or that the value of reading diminishes on very short time scales, so regardless of the value of the alternatives being traded against it at different points, it is valuable to do a little every week (like eating). This seems unlikely, but perhaps I am missing something. I posit that students should value their time roughly as highly before graduating as after, as long as they have activities they consider as valuable as work to do at some point in their lives, which they can trade in to do before graduating without much loss.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":5,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000148,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"omCFSYF6MZqRFRJCv","postedAt":"2013-06-18T04:00:19.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Giving now currently seems to beat giving later","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2015-04-24T22:48:47.535Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/omCFSYF6MZqRFRJCv/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>Effective altruists are interested in doing as much as they can to make the world a better place, and many of them think donating their money as effectively as possible is a good way to do that.

After all, why give up money today if that both gives you less to spend today, and gives you less in the future? So there wouldn&#x2019;t be any savings, or less than maximal borrowing, if people didn&#x2019;t expect more gains later from saving than from spending today.<p></p><p>This implies that unless charity recipients are saving nothing and borrowing as much as they possibly can, they must expect that you would benefit them more in the future by saving and giving them the returns of your savings later, than if you had given them the money today, even after taking into account all of the ways in which their spending today might help them in the future. So there really must be a tradeoff between helping today and helping later; if you help more today, you help less in the future. At least if you help them in a way they could have helped themselves, if only they had the money.</p></blockquote>\nOr, more basically, there are two concepts:<p></p><p>First, there is the <b>&quot;growth rate&quot;</b> of donation -- by donating to a non-profit <i>now</i>, they get to do things with your money <i>now</i>, helping people immediately who then could be in a better position to give back, or by spending money on dreaded &quot;overhead&quot; (<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/16/which-of-these-boasts-is-not-like-the-others/\">which isn&apos;t evil, by the way</a>, but that&apos;s a matter for another time), putting them in a better position to grow <i>now</i>.</p><p>Second, there is the <b>&quot;investment rate&quot;</b> of saving/investing your donation money rather than donating now. This should be the easier of the two concepts -- you save your money, it grows in a certain percentage, and then right before you&apos;re about to die, you take all that money out and donate it.</p><p>And then to oversimpify the complex topic, you should be willing to donate now as long as you think &quot;growth rate &gt; investment rate&quot;, and save now as long as you think &quot;investment rate &gt; growth rate&quot;, plus a few other complications to be discussed.\n</p><h2>Ok, so what&apos;s the investment rate, then?</h2>\nFinding out the precise investment rate is complicated, but I think Jeff Kaufman has done some really good work on it in <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-04-06\">&quot;What Rates of Return Should You Expect?&quot;</a>. Basically, many sites suggest returns on investment between 6% and 12%, but this (a) ignores the average of 3% inflation, (b) involves cherry-picking, and (c) only focuses on US data. Articles like The Economist&apos;s<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21571443-investors-may-have-developed-too-rosy-view-equity-returns-beware-bias\">&quot;Beware of the Bias&quot;</a> point this out.<p></p><p>So if we&apos;re really optimistic, we could consider the investment rate to be 12% and if we&apos;re really pessimistic, we could consider it to be 0%, or lower! But I&apos;d expect the real (inflation adjusted) rate of return on your investment to be between 3 and 5%. This means that if I had opted to instead take <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/donations-report\">the $659.70 donation</a> I made last year and instead invested in it, given that I expect to live around 70 more years, I could realistically realize $5,372.94 to $21,687.36 if compounded monthly.\n</p><h2>Ok, so what&apos;s the growth rate, then?</h2>\nBut what about the other side of the coin -- growth rate from your donation? I see the potential size of this being huge. Unlike the investment rate which I think is overestimated, the growth rate seems <i>underestimated</i>.<p></p><p>Honestly, whatever the growth rate is on your donation is going to depend largely and entirely on <i>where</i> you donate. But if you&apos;re donating to advocacy, you could realize really large returns because of what&apos;s called <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration\">the haste consideration</a>:\n</p><blockquote>[I]magine two worlds:<p></p><p>(1) You don&#x2019;t do anything altruistic for the next 2 years and then you spend the rest of your life after that improving the world as much as you can.</p><p>(2) You spend the next 2 years influencing people to become effective altruists and convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world. (And assume that this person wouldn&#x2019;t have done anything altruistic otherwise.) You do nothing altruistic after the next 2 years, but the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p><p>By stipulation, world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is because, in (2), the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p></blockquote>\nEssentially, convincing just one person to do what you would do (go vegetarian, join Giving What We Can, etc.) as ardently as you would do it (or nearly as much) would have the same effect as your entire life&apos;s work. Robin Hanson stated the case for giving later over giving now as &quot;if more now, less later&quot;.<p></p><p>But with the haste consideration, it&apos;s actually <b>if more now, more later</b>, because you&apos;ll be convincing people to do things they would otherwise have <i>not done at all</i> (presumably).</p><p>And you can donate money to convincing people -- by donating to <a href=\"http://www.veganoutreach.org\">Vegan Outreach</a> for veganism or <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can</a> directly for donation outreach. I have tried to calculate the <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/\">cost per converting a vegetarian elsewhere</a> and I&apos;m told by Will MacAskill that, if I&apos;m reading the spreadsheet he gave me right, it would cost an estimated $1779 to $4327 to acquire a new Giving What We Can member (I believe you can email him for details on that).</p><p>Thus, let&apos;s assume that, in my lifetime, I&apos;ll earn at least a $50K/year salary. Now assume that it costs a conservative $10K/year to recruit a Giving What We Can lifetime, committed member (who will also earn at least a $50K/year salary). I can either do two things:</p><p>(1) invest 10% of my salary each year at 5% return compounded monthly, and then, upon my death, buy as many committed GWWC members as possible.\n(2) donate 10% of my salary each year to buy as many committed GWWC members as possible.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.daveramsey.com/article/investing-calculator/lifeandmoney_investing/#/entry_form\">this investment calculator</a> (which I used earlier), option #1 will yield $3,200,782.84, which could buy 320 committed GWWC members.</p><p>Option #2 would add a committed member every two years, producing 45 committed GWWC members over my predicted 70 year lifespan. This looks bad, but now remember that each of those members would then get a chance to recruit new members using <i>their</i> money. The first person I get would then commit $340K of their own lifetime earnings over the remaining period (68 years, since I recruited them on year 2, at $5K/year contribution). I&apos;d only need to recruit ten members myself to dwarf the investment strategy, and that&apos;s not even counting all the second-stage members <i>those</i> first-stage members recruit.</p><p>At this point, I wish I was a math major and knew how to calculate this out with a simple formula. Instead, I talked to a math major (who is also a GWWC member), and he mentioned that basically, the group effectively doubles over the two year period. I save up to $10K at year two and recruit someone, and then in two years (year #4) we both have $10K and recruit someone, and then in two more years (year #6) all four of us recruit have $10K and recruit someone each, bringing the total amount of people recruited to twelve. By year #70, I will have recruited, directly and indirectly, 1+2<sup>34</sup> people, or 17.1 billion new GWWC members.</p><p>Obviously, this is implausible because there aren&apos;t even 17 billion people and recruitment efforts would certainly be nonlinear. And there are other problems. But it&apos;s a simple way to prove the point. Hopefully this shows the benefit of compounding via the haste consideration to <b>recruit new people who wouldn&apos;t have donated their money otherwise.</b></p><p>Even if Option #1 were considered to recruit people who then saved all their money and recruited other people, by year #140 it would only have 102,400 people recruited, whereas Option #2 would have roughly 10<sup>41</sup> people recruited.</p><p>Even if the growth rate isn&apos;t 100% every two years, it&apos;s considerably higher than 5%, I think. Thus since growth rate &gt; interest rate, I advocate donating now. At least until someone finds the inevitable unobvious flaw in my thinking.</p><p>As Brian Tomasik argues in <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?t=824\">&quot;The Haste Consideration Reconsidered&quot;</a>, we&apos;ll probably hit diminishing marginal returns on GWWC recruiting soon, and thus should reconsider our donation target, re-evaluate the growth rate, and maybe shift back to investing rather than donating. But, <i>right now</i>, the prospects are still high and there are still many bright and active individuals who have not yet been recruited. Right now, we can use our money to make sure they use their money better.</p><p>Thus my answer to Robin Hanson: More (of our money) now, more (of their money) later. At least, while it lasts.\n</p><h2>Other complications</h2>\n<i>Now time to explore some additional factors that may modify the consideration. The main argument has been made and this is is basically appendix material. Feel free to stop reading at this point, if you wish.</i>\n<h3>US tax law</h3>\nThis is an obvious factor to consider, but US law says that if you donate instead of invest, you can claim a deduction. This deduction would appear annually, thus allowing you to donate additional money. If you&apos;re earning the 50K I was talking about earlier, you&apos;d be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States\">taxed at effectively 16.9%</a>. This would mean you could get back $845 on a $5K donation, assuming I understand tax law right.<p></p><p>If I donate $5K annually without investing, I&apos;d actually be able to donate $409,150 over my seventy years rather than the original $350,000. If I had invested and then donated it all, I&apos;d get $3,741,715.14 instead of $3,200,782.84.\n</p><h3>The changing nature of non-profits</h3>\nThere&apos;s a good chance that if Giving What We Can stopped receiving donations, it would just collapse and then the opportunity to donate to it in seventy years would be gone (though I suppose it could be refounded with the new cash). Additionally, GWWC couldn&apos;t learn from the seventy years of being able to operate, spend money, and try things.<p></p><p>And GWWC seems to be in a prime place right now to expand a lot and really grow it&apos;s outreach. Thus it&apos;s at a critical time to fund when the marginal cost to recruit a new member is at probably some of the lowest it will be. Now, not in seventy years, is a great time to get in.</p><p>Furthermore, I speculate that the marginal value will grow at a rate higher than the interest, such that $5K/year for seventy years would buy more members for GWWC than a flat $3.7 million in seventy years would.</p><p><span>You might be smarter in the future</span></p><p>There&apos;s a good chance there might be better giving opportunities in seventy years, identified through our collective greater intelligence, your years of added experience, and the changing world (though <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/\">GiveWell disagrees</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research/donating-vs-investing\">as does GWWC</a>). This could mean it is better to give later, because you could be donating to an overall higher impact opportunity.\n</p><h3>You might change your values</h3>\nSome people are concerned that if they stored their donation money for seventy years, their future self might not care to donate it anymore. Personally, the way I view my personal identity, I&apos;d rather have done what my future self wanted me to do, so if my future self seventy years from now wished I would have been less altruistic, I want to be less altruistic now, so I don&apos;t see this as a concern. But if you do, you should donate now, before your future self has a chance to redirect the money.<p></p><p>One way to protect from this might be to use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_advised_fund\">donor advised fund</a>, which would also get the benefit of more charity deductions (since you can deduct each contribution to your fund) and your future wisdom while forcing your future self to donate.\n</p><h3>Better advocacy</h3>\nIt seems much easier to convince someone to give a little each year than to follow a solid savings plan -- as Scott Alexander states, there <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/05/investment-and-inefficient-charity/\">are some strange psychological effects</a> that make us feel strongly like giving now and giving regularly is better, and we can secure the warm fuzzies feelings and social status of being considered a regular donor.<p></p><p>Moreover, if you convinced a friend to donate, you&apos;d know much more immediately if they actually plan on sticking to it if you can see a donation they make in December rather than having to wait until they die. (Though I suppose this too could be solved by having them contribute to your donor advised fund, if they trust you a lot. But I imagine the average person wouldn&apos;t.)</p><p>Thus even if privately you should save, I think the best strategy to adopt publicly (when not speaking from an analytical point-of-view) is to encourage others to donate now.</p><p><i>An earlier version of this post appeared on <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></i></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"FBTCnrdQp9aDa6AJ3":1,"mMC3LEMAJWx4FbHW3":1},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000081,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-12-28T14:23:35.786Z","name":"Timing of philanthropy","slug":"timing-of-philanthropy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>timing of philanthropy</strong> is the selection of the optimal schedule for philanthropic donations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/investing\">investing</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/patient-altruism\">patient altruism</a></p>\n","postCount":54,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"FBTCnrdQp9aDa6AJ3"},{"createdAt":"2020-08-11T23:22:48.179Z","name":"Patient altruism","slug":"patient-altruism","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Patient altruism</strong> (sometimes called <strong>patient longtermism</strong>) is the view that individuals can have a greater positive impact by investing current altruistic resources and spending them later than by spending them now.

I looked at the rest of my life as more of an obligation than a joy.</p><p>So my husband and I decided that it wasn&apos;t worth having a breakdown over. We decided to set aside enough for our personal spending that we could reasonably afford to raise a child. Looking back at my journal entries from before and after the decision, I&apos;m struck by how much difference it made in my outlook. Immediately after we gave ourselves permission to be parents, I was excited about the future again. I don&apos;t know if or when we&apos;ll actually have a kid, but just the possibility helps me feel things will be all right. And I suspect that feeling of satisfaction with my own life lets me be more help to the world than I would have as a broken-down altruist.</p><p>I&apos;ve attended Quaker meeting for the last ten years. The founder, George Fox, gave his followers this advice in 1658: &#x201C;Be patterns, be examples in all countries, places, islands, nations wherever you come; that your carriage and life may preach among all sorts of people, and to them; then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in everyone; whereby in them you may be a blessing.&#x201D;</p><p>Quakers have tended to emphasize the part about &#x201C;that of God in everyone,&#x201D; with its implication about equality: how can it be right to keep slaves, for example, if the slave has an element of the divine in her?</p><p>But my favorite part is that word &#x201C;cheerfully.&#x201D; Fox was a man who had been jailed and beaten for his religious beliefs &#x2013; surely he had a right to be bitter. Quakerism later developed a stern and dour style, but George Fox was not about that.</p><p>Some things I can do cheerfully. It turns out that giving up children was not one of them. Other people would have no problem giving up parenthood, but I suspect that everyone has something that would cause an inordinate amount of pain to sacrifice.</p><p>So test your boundaries, and see what changes you can make that will help others without costing you too dearly. But when you find that something is making you bitter, stop. Effective altruism is not about driving yourself to a breakdown. We don&apos;t need people making sacrifices that leave them drained and miserable. We need people who can walk cheerfully over the world, or at least do their damnedest.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"xXRMBbnoM2P8BPF4k":11,"DXfPYEx7G8wAbEZTc":1,"Y58JXAG3TYRFphwyf":1},"voteCount":64,"baseScore":79,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000457,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T11:29:29.967Z","name":"Effective altruism lifestyle","slug":"effective-altruism-lifestyle","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>Posts with the <strong>effective altruism lifestyle</strong> tag discuss ways to integrate effective altruism with the rest of one's life.

Going hang gliding has 8 micromorts per trip &#x2014; that is, if you go hang gliding, there&#x2019;s a 1 in 125,000 chance that you&#x2019;ll die. And, if you expect to live 50 more years, taking 1 in 125,000 means losing 210 minutes of expected life.  So if you&#x2019;re an egoist you might reasonably think: &#x201C;Well, it sucks to lose 210 minutes of expected life, but it would be really fun to go hang gliding, I&#x2019;d have great memories, and so on, so I&#x2019;m willing to make the trade off&#x201D; and then jump off a cliff. (Attached to a hang glider, of course.)</p><p>However, if you&#x2019;re an EA, then it&#x2019;s not just your life on the line. If you&#x2019;re doing well, you should expect to save tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands of lives over the course of your lifetime--or to do an equivalent amount of good.  (I actually think that the amount of good you can do is far more than the value of saving hundreds of lives, but that requires argument and clarification, so I&#x2019;ll leave it for another time). So if you die young, all those lives are lost.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s suppose, then, that you expect to save 100 lives over the course of your future life. Given that, hang gliding doesn&#x2019;t look so attractive. The amount of fun from gliding will stay the same, let&#x2019;s suppose. But the cost is much greater. In fact, it&#x2019;s more than a hundred times greater: by hang gliding you create a 1 in 125,000 chance of dying, and you create this chance for the 100 people you would save as well. This brings the total expected loss of life to 21,200 minutes, or two weeks of life. If thinking just in terms of self-interest, would you take a roughly one in 1,000 chance of death, losing two expected weeks of life, for the fun of hang gliding? Probably not. And if not, then you shouldn&apos;t take that benefit to yourself when it&apos;s other people&apos;s lives on the line either. So, to a very first approximation, as an EA you shouldn&#x2019;t go hang gliding. In general, EAs should be much more concerned about their own survival than they might intuitively be inclined to be.</p><p>(NB: there&#x2019;s much more to say on this issue, including: weighing risks of death that save you time; risks that make you more productive; and looking into which particular activities are too risky to be worth it, and which are ok. I&#x2019;ll elaborate in further posts.)\n</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000099,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"WqATQy9erBHLqPfGR","postedAt":"2013-06-26T04:00:15.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"What Is earning to give?","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":null,"pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WqATQy9erBHLqPfGR/what-is-earning-to-give","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about a concept called &quot;earning to give&quot; and some effective altruists are doing it. But what is it?</p><p>Well, you know how some people talk about &quot;doing well by doing good&quot;? &quot;Earning to give&quot; is basically &quot;doing good by doing well&quot; -- you look specifically for a high paying job in order to earn a lot of money, and then use your large disposable income to donate to charity.</p><p>For instance, one might think to join a non-profit and do important work and earn a salary of $30K. Or, one might instead choose to become a banker or stock trader, earn $100K+, keep the same salary of $30K, and and donate the $70K+ and hire <i>two or more</i> charity workers to serve in their place. Chances are good that those two charity workers who displace you will do more good combined than you will have done if you worked in their place, and that you displaced someone who would have joined finance but not donated their money.</p><p>As Jeff Kaufman <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-11\">considers summarizing it</a>, the idea is to &quot;[g]ive money to the most effective charities, and maximize your impact by earning more and spending less.&quot; A basic introduction of this idea can be found in the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give\">80000 Hours topic</a> and <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/faq#faq-what-is-earning-to-give\">corresponding FAQ</a>.

Brooks argues that (1) you risk losing your motivation and (2) you risk not living a sufficiently &quot;full&quot; life. Alexander Berger <a href=\"http://marginalchange.blogspot.ca/2013/06/2013-david-brooks-vs-2011-david-brooks.html\">responds</a>, pointing out that burnout is a risk, but the motivations of those people earning to give are definitely there and that they are living &quot;full&quot; lives.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam\">objection in the National Review</a> that suggests &quot;earning to give&quot; favors individual action and ignores the good that can come from public action. This is <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage\">responded to by 80,000 Hours</a>, which says it&apos;s a political point being read that doesn&apos;t actually exist.</p><p>Ben Kuhn <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections\">looks at more objections</a> that surfaced in the comments sections of various articles, and he finds that people object to (1) some &quot;earning to give&quot; careers (like banking) doing bad by promoting negative capitalist systems, (2) that where &quot;earning to give&quot; people are giving (mostly the <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> ignores focusing on &quot;root causes&quot; in favor of addressing symptoms, and (3) general objections to utilitarianism. Kuhn addresses those arguments in that article.</p><p>Jeff Kaufman also looks at objections to banking as a career and <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-06-03\">proposes we talk about other careers instead</a>, like computer programming, teacher, or social worker. Julia Wise writes about <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html\">how she could still &quot;earn to give&quot; on a $38K salary</a>.</p><p></p><h2>But is &quot;earning to give&quot; actually a good idea?</h2>\nSo all this is great, and I&apos;m glad there&apos;s a big conversation now on effectiveness and considering career choice as an ethical question. However, while the level of criticism I&apos;ve seen in the popular press isn&apos;t great, there definitely are objections to &quot;earning to give&quot; that matter.<p></p><p><b>First, I think the issue of burnout is considered by those who think about &quot;earning to give&quot;, but never directly addressed.</b> How many people pursuing &quot;earning to give&quot; end up burning out? And what happens then? Can one really choose <i>any</i> high-earning career and do well at it, or does one also need some sort of direct passion for the job?</p><p><b>Second, can&apos;t there be more beneficial careers than &quot;earning to give&quot;?</b> Generally, I agree with <a href=\"&lt;a href=\">80,000 Hours&apos;s response</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-02\">Jeff Kaufman&apos;s consideration</a> that &quot;earning to give&quot; is a <i>baseline</i>, not the best option. It&apos;s a useful and powerful point of comparison to ask &quot;Is what I&apos;m doing better than just earning a higher salary and donating it?&quot;.</p><p>Frequently, however, I think this baseline can be beaten. While there&apos;s a &quot;make more money to donate&quot; side of things, there&apos;s also a &quot;make the donated money work better&quot; side, working in the organizations themselves to increase the impact of each donation by increasing the impact of the organizations themselves. As Jeff Kaufman records in <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-05-20\">&quot;Talent or Money&quot;</a>, some organizations like <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can</a> probably would benefit more from additional talent than additional money. In <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/node/31\">&quot;Earning to Give vs. Altruistic Career Choice Revisited&quot;</a>, Jonah Sinick discusses that consideration among a few others.</p><p>Overall, the career you choose is an incredibly important choice to consider not just from a personal perspective, but from an ethical perspective. But it&apos;s also a very individual choice and the good one can do with their career and the satisfaction they can get out of it depend immensely on one&apos;s individual talents and desires. Therefore, a would-be career do-gooder should instead try to find individualized advice (such as that offered by <a href=\"http://www.80000hours.org\">80000 Hours</a>) and consider a wider variety of careers.</p><p><em>An earlier version of this post appeared on <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-4-earning-to-give/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"pg5MHgnpDWnnWDTyY":8},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":10,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000108,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-16T01:59:13.259Z","name":"Earning to give","slug":"earning-to-give","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Earning to give</strong> is the pursuit of a lucrative career with the purpose of donating a significant portion of the earnings to cost-effective organizations.</p><p>The value of earning to give may not be immediately obvious, since people tend to think of ethical jobs as those with a <i>direct</i> positive impact.

I can give someone else a year of healthy life for about $50 [1] and there&apos;s no way $50 can do anywhere near that much to help me.  I could go through my life constantly <a href=\"http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html\">weighing every purchase</a> against the good it could do, but this would make me miserable.  So how do I accept that other people need my money more without giving up on being happy myself?</p><p>For me the key is to make most choices donation neutral.  As money comes in I divide it into &quot;money to give to the most effective charity&quot; and &quot;money to spend as I wish&quot;.  How to divide it is a hard and distressing choice, but it&apos;s one I only have to make once a year. Then when deciding to buy something (socks, rent, phone, instruments, food) I know it&apos;s money that isn&apos;t getting given away regardless, so I don&apos;t have to feel constantly guilty about making tradeoffs with people&apos;s lives.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia</a> and I have been using this system since 2009. [2] It&apos;s mostly worked well, but it&apos;s needed some additions.  The main issue is that declining to spend money on yourself isn&apos;t the only way to trade off benefits to other people against costs to yourself.  For example you could decide to be vegan, <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-06-17\">donate a kidney</a>, or cash out your vacation days and give away the money.  For ones that generate money directly (cashing out vacation) the solution is simple: that money goes into the pool that can&apos;t be given away.  For ones that don&apos;t generate money you would convert them into money via the good you think they do. Take the most effective charity you know about, figure out how much you would need to give to them in order to have the same positive effect, and then move that amount of money from donations to self-spending.  For example, I might estimate that giving $100 to the AMF does about as much good as being vegan for a year, so if I decided to go ahead with being vegan I would decrease my annual donations by $100 and allocate another $100 to spend on myself.</p><p>I may or may not decide that having another $X to spend on myself is better than sacrifice Y, but whichever way I decide I&apos;m working to make myself as happy as possible for a given amount of doing good. It&apos;s not a choice that has additional lives saved weighing on either side of it.</p><p>(This doesn&apos;t deal with a potentially important category: things that only make you somewhat unhappy.  For example, working a higher paying job you like less, or pushing yourself to host more <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.meetup.com/\">effective  altruism meetups</a> than you&apos;d really like to.  I don&apos;t see how to deal with this, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s been a problem so far.)</p><p><br></p><p>[1] Specifically, I can donate to the Against Malaria Foundation, which distributes anti-malarial nets.  The main effect is averting deaths of children who will probably go on to live around 30 years once you take into account other things they might die from.  This comes to about $75 per additional year of life.

It&#x2019;s main thesis is that by being a &#x2018;giver&#x2019; in relationships &#x2014; by helping other people as much as possible, without any expectation of your favours being returned in the near future &#x2014; you end up being much more successful, in a wide variety of settings, in the long run. It&#x2019;s interesting, well written, and informative. I&#x2019;d recommend it.</p><p>It got me thinking about helping each other in the EA community. Grant is suggesting that we underestimate the value of helping others as a way of benefitting ourselves in the long run. If that&#x2019;s true, then within the effective altruism community we probably radically underestimate the value of helping other EAs to be more successful.</p><p>The norms we are used to, and have internalised, govern situations where, in general (but by no means always), everyone is looking to benefit themselves. So you help other people in order that you can benefit yourself, and we should have expected the norms that we&#x2019;ve internalised (like &#x2018;tit for tat&#x2019;) to be good norms for governing that sort of interaction. However, if you and I share the same values, the social situation is very different: if I help you achieve your aims, then that&#x2019;s a success, in terms of achieving my aims too. Titting constitutes winning in and of itself &#x2014; there&#x2019;s no need for a tat in reward. For this reason, we should expect very different norms than we are used to be optimal: giving and helping others will be a good thing to do much more often than it would be if we were all self-interested.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll end with an exhortation. One of the incredible strengths of the EA community is that we all share values and share the same end-goals. This gives us a remarkable potential for much more in-depth cooperation than is normal in businesses or other settings where people are out for themselves. So next time you talk to another effective altruist, ask them how you can help them achieve their aims. It can be a great way of achieving what you value.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"EHLmbEmJ2Qd5WfwTb":2},"voteCount":5,"baseScore":10,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000104,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-28T13:22:17.182Z","name":"Building effective altruism","slug":"building-effective-altruism-1","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Building effective altruism</strong> refers to the family of interventions aimed at growing, shaping or otherwise improving <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism\">effective altruism</a> as an intellectual community.</p><p>Examples of movement building include starting student groups, writing articles, and organizing social gatherings for people interested in effective&nbsp;altruism.</p><p>There is a relevant distinction between work that increases outside awareness of the movement and work that increases its favorability.

It goes something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Peter Singer suggests that if I see a child drowning in a pond, I would probably jump in and save them even if I&#x2019;m wearing $500 non-waterproof boots. He concludes that because of this, I should donate $500 to charity, where it can save a child&#x2019;s life. But what happens if you take this to its logical conclusion? I would spend all my money on charity and live in a cardboard box! And you can&#x2019;t expect me to do that! I guess I&#x2019;m not going to listen to Peter Singer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I know this is a common objection because I used it to dismiss Peter Singer for two years before I realized that there might be a <em>reason</em> that he himself spent money on things like suits and a house. So if you are talking to someone about effective altruism, be aware of this!)</p>\n<p>The problem with this objection is that it takes a very short-term view of optimizing the size of your donation, because it takes money to earn money. If you donate your entire income (and assets) to the Against Malaria Foundation this year and go live in a cardboard box, then your income will be much smaller next year, because nobody wants to hire people who live in cardboard boxes.</p>\n<p>In fact, pretty much every donation that would otherwise be spent on solving a problem in your own life has some opportunity cost, even if the problem it&#x2019;s solving doesn&#x2019;t directly cost you very much time or money. This is because even for relatively small problems, if you don&#x2019;t solve them, they will take up your attention while you worry about them. Attention can otherwise be spent on doing valuable things, which can be converted into money.</p>\n<p>In fact, the rate can be quite high. For instance, I recently bought a second monitor. If I were carrying it on my back and saw a drowning child, I would jump into the pond, save the child, and fry the monitor. But then I would go buy another monitor, because I realized that if I&#x2019;m switching back and forth between programming, documentation, and other windows all the time, the ones in the background consume nagging bits of attention and I get a lot worse at doing high-value tasks like programming. I calculate that given my hourly wage, if my second monitor makes me even 1% better at programming because I can keep track of more things, it will pay for itself in less than a year, so it&#x2019;s a definite win.</p>\n<p>Now, there&#x2019;s definitely some inflection point of wealth at which you should stop spending money to solve your own problems, because they&#x2019;re so minor it&#x2019;s just not worth it. And I agree with Peter Singer that this point is lower than most people think it is (since day-to-day well-being stops rising with incomes over $75,000, (<sup><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>) we might infer that much of the money people spend on themselves doesn&#x2019;t help at all with solving their own problems and could be redirected harmlessly). But I think this inflection point is also a fair amount higher than a naive reading of Singer&#x2019;s diving-into-the-pond example would imply, and it&#x2019;s important to make this clear when introducing this argument.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Kahneman, Daniel, and Angus Deaton. 2010. &#x201C;High Income Improves Evaluation of Life but Not Emotional Well-being.&#x201D; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107 (38) (September 21): 16489&#x2013;16493. doi:<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1011492107\">10.1073/pnas.1011492107</a>.&#xA0;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":1,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000004252596909051593,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"pfbLKnJmDKYSPPCEW","postedAt":"2013-07-08T04:00:02.000Z","modifiedAt":"2021-08-25T00:13:02.205Z","title":"Four focus areas of effective altruism","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2022-01-09T10:15:31.603Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pfbLKnJmDKYSPPCEW/four-focus-areas-of-effective-altruism","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>It was a pleasure to see all major strands of the <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">effective altruism movement</a> gathered in one place at last week&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/\">Effective Altruism Summit</a>.</p><p>Representatives from&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/\">Effective Animal Altruism</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.leverageresearch.org/\">Leverage Research</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>, and the <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> either attended or gave presentations.&#xA0;My thanks to Leverage Research&#xA0;for organizing and hosting the event!</p><p>What do all these groups have in common?

Typically, the most cost-effective altruistic cause won&apos;t happen to be in one&apos;s home country.</span></li>\n\t<li><strong>Value consequences</strong>: EAs tend to value causes according to their consequences, whether those consequences are happiness, health, justice, fairness and/or other values.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Try to do as much good as possible</strong>: EAs don&apos;t just want to do <em>some</em> good; they want to do (roughly)&#xA0;<em>as much good as possible</em>. As such, they hope to devote their altruistic resources (time, money, energy, attention) to unusually cost-effective causes. (This <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">doesn&apos;t</a> necessarily mean that EAs think &quot;explicit&quot; cost effectiveness calculations are the best <em>method for&#xA0;figuring out</em> which causes are likely to do the most good.)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Think scientifically and quantitatively</strong>: EAs tend to be analytic, scientific, and quantitative when trying to figure out which causes <em>actually</em> do the most good.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Be willing to make significant life changes to be more effectively altruistic</strong>: As a result of their efforts to be more effective in their altruism, EAs often (1) change which charities they support financially, (2) change careers, (3) spend significant chunks of time investigating which causes are most cost-effective according to their values, or (4) make other significant life changes.</li>\n</ol>\nDespite these similarities, EAs are a diverse bunch, and they focus their efforts on a variety of causes.<p></p><p>Below are four popular focus areas of effective altruism, ordered roughly by how large and visible they appear to be at the moment. Many EAs work on several of these focus areas at once, due to uncertainty about both facts and values.</p><p>Though labels and categories <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/od/37_ways_that_words_can_be_wrong/\">have</a> <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html\">their</a> <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/alternative-truths/201005/why-its-dangerous-label-people\">dangers</a>, they can also enable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)\">chunking</a>, which has benefits for memory, learning, and communication. There are many other ways we might categorize the efforts of today&apos;s EAs; this is only one categorization.\n</p><h2><strong>Focus area 1: Poverty reduction</strong></h2>\nHere, &quot;poverty reduction&quot; is meant in a broad sense that includes (e.g.) economic benefit, better health, and better education.<p></p><p>Major organizations in this focus area include:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>&#xA0;is home to the most rigorous research on charitable causes, especially poverty reduction and global health. Their current charity recommendations are the <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>. (Note that GiveWell also does quite a bit of &quot;meta effective altruism&quot;; see below.)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\">Good Ventures</a>&#xA0;works closely with GiveWell.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>&#xA0;(TLYCS), named after Peter Singer&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/0812981561/\">book</a> on effective altruism, encourages people to pledge a fraction of their income to effective charities. TLYCS currently recommends GiveWell&apos;s recommended charities and <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/WheretoDonate.aspx\">several others</a>.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>&#xA0;(GWWC) does some charity evaluation and also encourages people to pledge 10% of their income effective charities. GWWC currently recommends two of GiveWell&apos;s recommended charities and <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities\">two others</a>.</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition, some well-endowed foundations seem to have &quot;one foot&quot; in effective poverty reduction. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> has funded many of the most cost-effective causes in the developing world (e.g. vaccinations),&#xA0;although it also funds less cost-effective-seeming interventions in the developed world.<p></p><p>In the future, poverty reduction EAs might&#xA0;also focus on economic, political, or research-infrastructure changes that might achieve poverty reduction, global health, and educational improvements more&#xA0;indirectly, as when&#xA0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform\">Chinese economic reforms</a>&#xA0;lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. Though it is generally easier to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of direct efforts than that of indirect efforts, some groups (e.g. <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/\">GiveWell Labs</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.vannevargroup.org/\">The Vannevar Group</a>) are beginning to evaluate the likely cost-effectiveness of these causes.\n</p><h2><strong>Focus area 2: Meta effective altruism</strong></h2>\nMeta effective altruists focus less on specific causes and more on &quot;meta&quot; activities such as raising awareness of the importance of evidence-based altruism, helping EAs reach their potential, and doing research to help EAs decide which focus areas they should contribute to.<p></p><p>Organizations in this focus area include:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>&#xA0;highlights the importance of helping the world effectively through one&apos;s career. They also offer personal counseling to help EAs choose a career and a set of causes to support.</li>\n\t<li>Explicitly, the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>&#xA0;(CFAR) just trains people in rationality skills. But&#xA0;<em>de facto</em>&#xA0;they are especially focused on the application of rational thought to the practice of altruism, and are deeply embedded in the effective altruism community.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.leverageresearch.org/\">Leverage Research</a> focuses on growing and empowering the EA movement, e.g. by running <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/\">Effective Altruism Summit</a>, by organizing the <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">THINK</a> student group network, and by searching for &quot;mind hacks&quot; (like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci\">memory palace</a>) that can make EAs more effective.</li>\n</ul>\nOther people and organizations contribute to meta effective altruism, too. Paul Christiano examines effective altruism from a high level at <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a>. GiveWell and others often write about the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/\">ethics</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">epistemology</a> of effective altruism in addition to focusing on their chosen causes. And, of course, most EA organizations spend&#xA0;<em>some</em> resources growing the EA movement.\n<h2><strong>Focus area 3: The far future</strong></h2>\nMany EAs value future people roughly as much as currently-living people, and therefore think that nearly all potential value is found in the well-being of the astronomical numbers of people who could populate the far future (<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/AstronomicalWaste.pdf\">Bostrom 2003</a>; <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research/Beckstead%2C%20Nick--On%20the%20Overwhelming%20Importance%20of%20Shaping%20the%20Far%20Future.pdf\">Beckstead 2013</a>). Future-focused EAs aim to somewhat-directly&#xA0;capture these &quot;astronomical benefits&quot; of the far future, e.g. via explicit efforts to <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">reduce existential risk</a>.<p></p><p>Organizations in this focus area include:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><span>The <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a> at Oxford University is the primary hub of research on <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">existential risk mitigation</a> within the effective altruism movement. (<a href=\"http://cser.org/\">CSER</a> may join it soon, if it gets funding.)</span></li>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a>&#xA0;focuses on doing the research needed for humanity to one day build <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence\">Friendly AI</a> that could make astronomical numbers of future people enormously better off. It also runs the <a href=\"/\">Less Wrong</a> group blog and forum, where much of today&apos;s EA analysis and discussion occurs.</li>\n</ul>\nOther groups study particular existential risks (among other things), though perhaps not explicitly from the view of effective altruism. For example, NASA has spent time <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/shallow/asteroid-detection\">identifying nearby asteroids</a> that could be an existential threat, and many organizations (e.g. <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/\">GCRI</a>) study worst-case scenarios for climate change or nuclear warfare that <em>might</em> result in human extinction but are more likely to result in &quot;merely catastrophic&quot; damage.<p></p><p>Some EAs (e.g.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">Holden Karnofsky</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/03/my-outlook/\">Paul Christiano</a>) have argued that even if nearly all value lies in the far future, focusing on nearer-term goals (e.g. effective poverty reduction or meta effective altruism) may be more likely to realize that value than more direct efforts.\n</p><h2><strong>Focus area 4: Animal suffering</strong></h2>\nEffective animal altruists are focused on reducing animal suffering in cost-effective ways. After all, animals vastly outnumber humans, and growing numbers of scientists <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness#Cambridge_Declaration_on_Consciousness\">believe</a> that many animals <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness\">consciously experience</a> pleasure and suffering.<p></p><p>The only organization of this type so far (that I know of) is <a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/\">Effective Animal Activism</a>, which currently recommends supporting <a href=\"http://thehumaneleague.com/\">The Humane League</a> and <a href=\"http://www.veganoutreach.org/\">Vegan Outreach</a>.</p><p>Major inspirations for those in this focus area include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer\">Peter Singer</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pearce_(philosopher)\">David Pearce</a>, and <a href=\"http://utilitarian-essays.com/\">Brian Tomasik</a>.\n</p><h2><strong>Other focus areas</strong></h2>\nI could perhaps have listed &quot;effective environmental altruism&quot; as focus area 5. The environmental movement <em>in general</em>&#xA0;is large and well-known, but I&apos;m not aware of many effective altruists who take environmentalism to be the most important cause for them to work on, after closely investigating the above focus areas.

And as we all know, a highly effectively altruistic thing to do is bring about more effective altruism. However, the optimal mixture of activities for promoting effectiveness is not identical to that for promoting altruism. They are upheld by different norms, and require different efforts to expand and arguments to proliferate. Which brings us to a need for prioritization. So, which is better: effectiveness or altruism?</p><p>By this I mean, which is the better recipient of marginal promotion effort?</p><p>For background, I&#x2019;m visiting the <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Oxford</a> <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">Effective</a> <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Altruists</a> at the moment. Conversations here made it salient to me that my implicit views on this question have changed a lot since I was a teenager, and also differ from others&#x2019; in the EA movement. So I thought I&#x2019;d lay them out.</p><p>When I was younger, I thought altruism was about the most promising way to make the world better. There were extremely cheap figures around for the cost to save a human life, and people seemed to not care. So prima facie it seemed that the highly effective giving opportunities were well worked out, and the main problem was that people tended to give $2 to such causes occasionally, rather than giving every spare cent they had, that wasn&#x2019;t already earmarked for something more valuable than human lives.</p><p>These days I am much more optimistic about improving effectiveness than altruism, and not just because I&#x2019;m less naive about cost-effectiveness estimates. Here are some considerations:\n</p><h2>Past success</h2>\nSo far, effectiveness has bought more than altruism for EAs, arguably. That is, giving an ordinary amount highly effectively will buy more good than giving a highly altruistic amount in an ordinary way. The difference between a normal amount of giving and a highly altruistic one is around 20x by my reckoning. I&#x2019;m not sure what the mean charity is, but my impression is that it is less than 1/20th as useful as the best things we know of. Better data on this welcome.<p></p><p>Furthermore, perhaps the quest for producing altruistic value can learn from the more popular quest to produce selfish value. There have been efforts both to encourage people to be more selfish (see <a title=\"Ayn Rand\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand\">Ayn Rand</a>) and to find cost-effective ways to direct selfish efforts. As far as I can tell, the former might even produce negative selfish value for people, whereas mankind has become reasonably good at finding selfishly valuable investments. But you might reasonably retort that the quest for selfish value has less to gain from changing values, given the ubiquity of selfishness. Also, selfish people have little reason to spread selfishness. The spread of useful understanding for prioritizing selfish actions is perhaps largely because information is reusable and hard to contain.\n</p><h2>Neglect</h2>\nEffectiveness is much rarer and altruism more common than I assumed when younger. <span>Altruism is actually done to extremes reasonably often. </span>Perhaps more importantly, pushing for effectiveness is much rarer than pushing for altruism. People are neither naturally very effective in their altruistic endeavors, nor driven to look for effectiveness and praise it in others. <span>Altruism on the other hand is universally liked, and celebrated in others. It is searched for on first dates, and praised at funerals. Quite a lot of effort has been put into encouraging it. </span>\n<h2>Room for more funding (marginal value)</h2>\nThere appear to be high value ways to encourage effectiveness, such as by doing or funding the research others need to be effective, and making it appealing to use. For instance, it seems that producing trustworthy prioritization of high level causes (e.g. poverty alleviation vs. technological progress) could easily produce more value from redirecting others&#x2019; funds than one competent person&#x2019;s lifetime of giving to AMF, and I think would take less than one competent person&#x2019;s lifetime. So I think such prioritization is a better investment than AMF, which makes it a good investment.<p></p><p>In encouraging altruism, I don&#x2019;t know of any particularly promising directions. The most effective I have seen is probably <a title=\"Peter Singer\" href=\"http://https://www.princeton.edu/~psinger/\">Peter Singer</a>&#x2018;s method, of writing for a popular audience, encouraging readers to resolve their moral inconsistencies in favor of altruism. I&#x2019;m not sure if you can do such a thing again however; the low hanging fruit may be eaten, and Singer may have been especially well equipped to pick them.\n</p><h2>Upside</h2>\nThere&#x2019;s only so altruistic a person can be, and the limit is within about an order of magnitude of where a lot of people are. We know what this would look like: about ten times better than what a <a title=\"Giving What We Can\" href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> member&#x2019;s achievements looks like. It seems on the other hand that there are much higher reaches of good prioritization that we haven&#x2019;t seen &#x2013; it isn&#x2019;t clear how good the best visible opportunities could be, if we could spot them.\n<h2>Flow-through effects</h2>\n<h3>Effectiveness probably leads to altruism more than the other way around</h3><p></p><p>An intuitive story is that if a person really cared about helping, they would be naturally driven to find exceptionally good ways to do so. The fact that &#x2018;effective altruism&#x2019; is a thing suggests this is not so, for whatever odd/cynical reason.</p><p>On the other hand, learning that one can can help others more cheaply than one thought, and having more confidence in the reliableness of the estimates producing this belief, seems to encourage altruism. People are moved by Peter Singer&#x2019;s story of the child in the pond in a way they would arguably <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/comment-page-1/#comment-571415\">not be</a> if the passerby had to make a very substantial sacrifice and was less confident about the outcome of his action. On the other hand, on the way to improving effectiveness, we <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">often</a> learn that things are less effective than we thought, which will presumably undermine altruism by this reasoning.</p><p></p><h3>Economics of information</h3><p></p><p>An abstract consideration in favor of expecting higher returns to encouraging effectiveness is that much progress on effectiveness is in the form of producing insights and other information, which can be shared, reused, and built upon.</p><p></p><h3>Effectiveness is more valuable when applied broadly</h3><p></p><p>My impression is that in every part of the world, not just in philanthropy, better systems for assessing opportunities and making good decisions promise great gains. Altruism is not the only place where where contemporary efforts are primitive. Progress in prioritizing altruistic endeavors should often be applicable to this larger worthy project. Progress in effectiveness often comes with the accumulation of insights and other information, and information can be shared, reused, and built upon in a way that a pile of altruists can&#x2019;t be so well. If people weren&#x2019;t altruistic at all, but were basically cooperative (for selfish reasons), and they could discern of good policies from bad as perfectly as publicly available information would allow, I think this would make the world much better.</p><p>Altruism too appears to have many benefits outside of philanthropy. If people were more considerate of one another in general, they would avoid many harms from externalities and failures to coordinate. My sense is that within the plausible ranges of change however, these gains are smaller. If everyone was extremely well meaning but as just as uncertain about how best to act as we are today I would also expect things to go better but not nearly as much.</p><p>One thing that contributes to these intuitions is my impression that the difference in social effects between a person who is nice enough to have enjoyable relationships and one who is particularly kind at cost to themself is smaller than the difference in effect between a person who has a good sense of how to achieve what they want, and one who acts without regard to strategy.</p><p>This intuition also depends on one&#x2019;s answer to the question of why things go wrong in the world. Some ills are intentional malice, some are unchecked side effects of selfishness, and some are from ignorance and error. Altruism makes a dent on malice and selfishness, whereas progress in effectiveness diminishes the costs from ignorance and error.</p><p>I&#x2019;m inclined to think that ignorance and error make up a large part of the problem, though not obviously most. My guess is selfishness makes up most of the rest, and malice is small.</p><p>Naively, avoiding ignorance and error should be an easier sell: everyone wants their own choices to be better, whereas I&#x2019;d expect more hesitance about increasing their willingness to sacrifice for others. However after effort has been put into both, this may not be true on the margin. Also, there are many ways to make people more altruistic in effect that don&#x2019;t involve changing their values per se, e.g. arranging for them to feel better when they are being altruistic, or to have social support for it.</p><p></p><h3>Measurement</h3><p></p><p>Ironically, cost-effectiveness seems hard to measure. You can go by the current value for money estimate of your best cause, but this has <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">a tendency</a> to decrease as the quality of the estimate increases. This makes it a less good target for improvement, as it is harder to know when you are improving it, and easier for standards to decline without anyone noticing (this should go under the next section). On the other hand, there are relatively good (if imperfect) measures of altruism, such as &#x2018;what fraction of your income do you give to charity?&#x2019;.</p><p></p><h3>Long term durability</h3><p></p><p>One last consideration is how changes in altruism and changes in effectiveness will last. I am not optimistic about changes in values lasting well. At first glance, if it was easy enough for you to shift others&#x2019; values, you might expect them to shift again the next time someone pushes on them. Perhaps the situation is more complicated though. For instance, perhaps altruism is stickier than other values: it just inherently makes more sense, so once you have it you keep it. Or perhaps it spreads more easily: only altruists care about spreading their values to others. But in these kinds of situations, spreading altruism is still not as helpful as it looks, because everyone will end up there soon enough anyway.</p><p>The same goes for people valuing &#x2018;being effective&#x2019; highly. However as I mentioned earlier, changes in effectiveness often involve insights that can accumulate. This makes it harder for progress to be completely reversed. Humans have come to not care much at all about hand-weaving, but still our accumulated insights on it mean that whenever anyone wants to weave stuff by hand, they can do it very effectively.</p><p>***</p><p>In summary, I think effectiveness is relatively neglected, though it has a better track record of success, more room for funding, better upsides, and produces better flow-through effects.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"EHLmbEmJ2Qd5WfwTb":2},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000095,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-28T13:22:17.182Z","name":"Building effective altruism","slug":"building-effective-altruism-1","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Building effective altruism</strong> refers to the family of interventions aimed at growing, shaping or otherwise improving <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism\">effective altruism</a> as an intellectual community.</p><p>Examples of movement building include starting student groups, writing articles, and organizing social gatherings for people interested in effective&nbsp;altruism.</p><p>There is a relevant distinction between work that increases outside awareness of the movement and work that increases its favorability.

The case where this consideration applies robustly is when you&#x2019;re considering doing some risky activity X, which gives you a pure pleasure or happiness boost, or makes your life better in some way that doesn&#x2019;t affect your ability to do good.</p><p>The first case where this consideration applies in a mitigated form is where that risky activity X also benefits your productivity. For example, suppose that you have some medical condition that is interfering with your ability to work, and in order to cure it you need to undergo general anaesthetic. General anaesthetic has 10 micromorts, giving you a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying &#x2014; not a sort of risk you want to take lightly. But if this condition really is affecting your productivity (and therefore your ability to do good), and you&#x2019;d be more than 0.001% more productive by curing your condition, then the expected value of curing the condition is positive.</p><p>The second case where this consideration applies in a mitigated form is where that risky activity X saves you time. Let&#x2019;s suppose that you can either drive or cycle to some destination 1 mile away. And let&#x2019;s suppose you&#x2019;re somewhere like Oxford where driving around the centre is slower than cycling. Cycling 1 mile creates 0.04 micromorts; driving one mile creates 0.005 micromorts. So, by the &#x201C;don&#x2019;t die&#x201D; argument you might think that you should drive. But you&#x2019;ve got to weigh that against the good you do in the time saved. Let&#x2019;s suppose that you&#x2019;d save 10 minutes by taking the bike, which you would spend working. What&#x2019;s the cost of those micromorts? Let&#x2019;s suppose you&#x2019;ve got 50 more productive years, that you work 60 hours a week, 48 weeks a year. In which case the expected cost of cycling is (0.04/100000)*(50*60*48*60) &#x2013; (0.005/100000)*(50*60*48*60) = 3 minutes.</p><p>So, to a very first approximation (and bearing in mind that these numbers are very sketchy!), it&#x2019;s worth it to cycle if it gives you more than 3 extra minutes of working time. I stipulated in the above case that cycling gives you 10 extra minutes of life. So, in that above case, you should cycle.</p><p>I say &#x2018;to a first approximation&#x2019; because you should apply a discount rate: almost certainly, you should value giving yourself 1hr in the future either more or less than you should value giving yourself 1hr now. If your discount rate is positive (and you value time in the future less than you value time now), then comparing time saved against expected life lost due to potential death will overestimate the badness of the risk of death.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"xXRMBbnoM2P8BPF4k":2},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":11,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000133,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T11:29:29.967Z","name":"Effective altruism lifestyle","slug":"effective-altruism-lifestyle","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>Posts with the <strong>effective altruism lifestyle</strong> tag discuss ways to integrate effective altruism with the rest of one's life.

I imagine many readers here donate to these charities. This makes it all the more surprising that it should be pretty easy to start a charity more effective than any of them.</p>\n<p>All you would need to do is found an organisation that fundraises for whoever GiveWell recommends, and raises more than a dollar with each dollar it receives. Is this hard? <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/48-fundraising-for-charity-a-career-for-effective-altruists\">Probably</a> <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=595\">not</a>. As a general rule, a dollar spent on fundraising seems to raise at least several dollars. It&#x2019;s a pretty simple and fast multiplier that obviously beats putting your money in the stock market. An independent organisation raising money for GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities should do even better than a typical fundraiser, thanks to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the strength of evidence, which is especially compelling to big donors</li>\n<li>the independent recommendation, which looks particularly credible and removes the perception of any ulterior motive</li>\n<li>a willingness to maximise (for example by targeting the wealthy, and focussing on regular or legacy donors)</li>\n<li>an intrinsic motivation to do good</li>\n<li>the freedom to choose which of the three organisations they promote, depending on who they are talking to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Putting your money into fundraising, rather than just giving it directly, does impose additional costs on the donors you inspire, and may &#x2018;crowd out&#x2019; gifts to other charities. However, the logic of giving to GiveWell&#x2019;s top rated charities is that they make (much) better use of money than most other individuals or organisations. So if you have a fundraising ratio significantly above 1:1, these downsides shouldn&#x2019;t much matter.</p>\n<p>You might ask: if fundraising is the best thing to do, why wouldn&#x2019;t AMF, SCI or GiveDirectly just spend the money you give them on fundraising? My guess is that it&#x2019;s simply a bad look. If they spend too much on fundraising, it will irrationally scare off their existing and potential donors. Even if a charity should ideally spend most of its receipts on further fundraising in order to grow more quickly, the option simply isn&#x2019;t available. The social norm against &#x2018;<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising\">optimising fundraising</a>&#x2018; is generally helpful, because intense competition between charities for donations would cause &#x2018;rent dissipation&#x2019;, and less total money would flow to charity recipients. But if your charity actually <em>is</em> much better than other charities, and so it&#x2019;s good when you &#x2018;take&#x2019; their money, this social norm does harm by preventing you from doing so.</p>\n<p>So, if you are <a href=\"http://robertwiblin.com/2012/04/06/the-principle-of-altruistic-arbitrage/\">unlike most donors</a> and <em>are</em> willing to have your money spent on effective fundraising, you can easily increase your impact several times over. Just help GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities take their fundraising efforts &#x2018;off the books&#x2019; by founding or giving to a separate organisation that does it for them.</p>\n<p>This isn&#x2019;t actually an impractical plan. Starting up a lean and effective fundraising organisation is difficult, but much easier than building a global team to distribute insecticide-treated bed nets. Any bright and energetic person in a rich country who went and received the necessary training would have a decent shot at getting such an organisation off the ground. If you would like to discuss the first steps required to make this happen, drop me an email (robertwiblin [at] gmail [dot] com) and I can put you in touch with a team already working on this approach, who could direct you towards legal and financial support.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"nGqPZkKJuiKfAqDcs":2,"RRcLA4Kn8pasimQZr":2},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":2,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000119,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:52:09.656Z","name":"Effective altruism funding","slug":"effective-altruism-funding","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>Posts with the <strong>effective altruism funding</strong> tag discuss EA funding networks, the availability of funds for different cause areas, grantmaking strategy, etc.</p>\n<p>Not meant for posts that discuss specific funding decisions (for that, use the \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/donation-writeup\">Donation Writeup</a>\" tag).</p>\n<p>Examples of EA funders includes: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism-funds\">EA Funds</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/open-philanthropy\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/survival-and-flourishing-fund\">Survival &amp; Flourishing Fund</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/founders-pledge\">Founders Pledge Funds</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/certificate-of-impact\">certificate of impact</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/diminishing-returns\">diminishing returns</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/grantmaking\">grantmaking</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/philanthropic-coordination\">philanthropic coordination</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/philanthropic-diversification\">philanthropic diversification</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/room-for-more-funding\">room for more funding</a></p>\n","postCount":205,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"nGqPZkKJuiKfAqDcs"},{"createdAt":"2020-12-28T14:43:56.699Z","name":"GiveWell","slug":"givewell","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>GiveWell</strong> is a nonprofit <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/charity-evaluation\">charity evaluator</a> based in San Francisco.

Note that</p><ul><li>I focus here on <i>slightly to moderately speeding or slowing the pace of global development and empowerment relative to what it is today</i>; this takes for granted that we can expect to see substantial development and empowerment in our future, and simply asks whether it is desirable that this development/empowerment happen more quickly or more slowly.</li><li>I focus on the odds of an extremely bright future relative to the odds of a future that is worse than the present. This means that I’m not only considering the contribution of empowerment and development to catastrophic risk; I’m also considering their contribution to “global upside possibilities.”</li></ul><p><strong>1. Some catastrophic risks seem clearly reduced, and not exacerbated, by technological/economic progress.</strong> These include “non-anthropogenic” risks, such as asteroids, supervolcanoes, and non-engineered pandemics. Development may give us better tools for anticipating and responding to these risks, and is unlikely to make them worse. In addition, risks like #4 and #5 from the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/possible-global-catastrophic-risks\">previous post on this topic</a> - which involve risks of slowing growth due to shortage of a particular resource, or a slowdown in innovation - seem clearly mitigated by a faster pace of development.</p><p><strong>2. Even for the catastrophic risks that seem exacerbated by development, I believe that </strong><i><strong>faster</strong></i><strong> development is likely safer than slower development (or, at worst, the net effect is highly ambiguous).</strong> This belief is based on the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/possible-global-catastrophic-risks\">previously articulated concept</a> of “global upside possibilities” - the belief that sufficient development may make the world not only better, but less at risk for major disruption by global catastrophe. If one accepts this view, it follows that <i>faster</i> overall development would mean less time between (a) the emergence of a given danger and (b) other developments that dramatically reduce risks. For example, faster development may bring the day closer when a highly dangerous synthetic pandemic can be designed, but it will also bring the day closer when we have the technologies and resources to manage such a risk (as well as potentially speeding the improvement of decision-making abilities and mental health worldwide, improving the capabilities of those who would mitigate such a risk and reducing the number of people who would contribute to it). Likewise, faster development may lead to higher carbon emissions, but is also likely to lead to better progress on alternative energy sources, more resources for adaptation mechanisms (much of the impact of climate change <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/impacts#Specificoutcomesofclimatechange\">depends on these resources</a>), and generally an environment more favorable to investing in climate change prevention.</p><p>There are certainly limitations to this reasoning. For one thing, it addresses “general” economic/technological development; the point remains that empowering people and developing technologies that are particularly likely to exacerbate risks can increase net risk, and that for any given risk there are particular kinds of growth that are more and less problematic in terms of that risk. (For example, the ideal scenario for dealing with climate change is one in which we see strong growth but also reduce carbon emissions.)</p><p>In addition, if there is a particular risk that has been clearly identified before it is yet technologically possible, and there is a promising plan for averting such a risk, it could be safer to experience slower development while the promising plan is executed. However, I know of no compelling examples of such dynamics today. (And in general, it is likely to be much easier to design a plan for responding to a risk when the risk is real and concrete rather than hypothetical.)</p><p><strong>3. I believe that a large proportion of the risk of global catastrophe comes from the category of “risks that remain unarticulated and unimagined.”</strong> I don’t believe the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/possible-global-catastrophic-risks\">list we made previously</a> - or any list that can be constructed with today’s available information - is close to comprehensive: I expect that many of the most threatening risks are simply outside what we are able to anticipate today.</p><p>I would guess that some such risks become nearer as economic/technological development progresses, while some do not. But in all cases, I believe that economic/technological development is likely to improve our resources for anticipating, preventing and adapting to global catastrophes, and that for the reasons articulated above, faster development is more likely to reduce the lag between the emergence of risks and responses to them (including “global upside possibilities” that dramatically reduce risks).</p><p><strong>4. A key part of my view is the belief that there are few outstanding cases in which it is clear that very particular actions need to be taken to avert particular risks.</strong> If there were a more compelling set of cases in which the right course of action were known, I would be more likely to believe that “slowing development until the right course of action can play out reduces risks, and generically speeding development increases them.” But as it is, I don’t see such clear-cut cases. The cases in which the necessary actions are clearest to me are those of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/global-catastrophic-risks/asteroid-detection\">asteroids</a> (which I think is a clear-cut case in which development reduces risks) and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/policy/anthropogenic-climate-change\">climate change</a> (which I see as highly ambiguous regarding the question of whether faster development is desirable, as discussed above).

Three years in, with nearly $10 billion donated, Haiti is still a mess: how can the international community have failed so badly?</p><p>The truth is, helping people in the aftermath of a disaster is extremely difficult. The resources of a healthy society that a charity could otherwise draw on are stretched to the breaking point or beyond. A major natural disaster like Haiti&apos;s earthquake can destroy the ports you need to bring in supplies and the roads you need to transport them. Hospitals that would be available are damaged or crowded beyond capacity. The government is overtaxed and past its ability to coordinate effectively. This doesn&apos;t mean that immediate aid is impossible, or that the need isn&apos;t great, but money spent after a disaster doesn&apos;t go nearly as far as it could if it were spent at other times or in other places.</p><p>Rebuilding after a disaster has less of these issues, but still has problems of its own. You&apos;re trying to accomplish twin goals: putting things back how they were before the disaster and making people better off. While these aren&apos;t generally at odds with each other, they&apos;re also not generally going to be best accomplished by the same projects. For example you might be dividing funds between building permanent housing and hygiene education. The housing clearly helps recover from the disaster while hygiene is working on a problem that, while certainly exacerbated by the disaster, was an issue before and is only partly related. Yet housing is very expensive for the amount it helps people while hygiene promotion is both cheap and effective. [1] This puts aid organizations in a very awkward position: people are donating because they want to help the people affected by the disaster rebuild and move on, but often the opportunities to help people the most are in other problems that existed before the disaster.</p><p>With this in mind, it is frustrating to read an article that in every tradeoff focuses on the negative, even to the point of arguing against both sides when a situation comes up repeatedly. For example, they first point out the harm of delay in school construction and transportation improvement:\n</p><blockquote>Surrounded by half-built cinder-block walls, jutting rebar and piles of stone and sand, some 480 students cram into 10 makeshift classrooms illuminated only by the natural light that seeps through the gap between the partial walls and the tin roofs. Then, no strangers to life&apos;s setbacks, they trudge miles home over muddy, treacherous mountain roads as darkness descends.</blockquote>\nOnly paragraphs later, however, they object to the amount of aid money spent on:\n<blockquote>... big-ticket, multiyear projects that were not directly related to the earthquake, among them improving the education system, developing agriculture in central Haiti and building roads all over the country.</blockquote>\nGranting that much of the negativity of the article is warranted, however, in that the money spent on earthquake relief really hasn&apos;t gone very far, it&apos;s illuminating to look at GiveWell&apos;s <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/01/13/haiti-earthquake-donations/\">blog post</a> from the day after the quake:\n<blockquote>According to the Disease Control Priorities Project, emergency aid is one of the worst uses of donations, despite being one of the most emotionally compelling. For more, see our post on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2008/08/29/the-case-against-disaster-relief/\">the cost-effectiveness of disaster-focused aid</a>.</blockquote>\nIn short, disasters aren&apos;t where you can do the most good with the money you can donate. The next time there&apos;s a major disaster, perhaps try to focus the emotion of the tragedy into giving to a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">well-reviewed charity</a> working on a problem that is less likely to make the news.<p></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"sWcuTyTB5dP3nas2t":2},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":3,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000072,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T23:09:43.581Z","name":"Global health and development","slug":"global-health-and-development","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>global health and development</strong> tag can cover any post about improving public health, reducing poverty, or increasing economic growth; most of these posts will discuss the developing world, but this isn't strictly necessary.</p><p>In 2013, roughly 767 million people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 per day, adjusted for purchasing power.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefphn1q4i5kdb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnphn1q4i5kdb\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Lack of economic resources has direct consequences on many aspects of people’s lives, including access to education and healthcare.

There are a variety of different reasons why we might discount the future: for instance, we might simply care less about the future than we do the present (this is known as <i>pure time preference</i>). Alternately, we might care just as much about my future, but think that there is some probability that it will not be possible to reap the benefits at that time (for instance, I might care less about my personal income in 40 years, simply because there's a reasonable chance that I will be dead by then, and not able to enjoy the income). A variety of other reasons might apply, depending on the good under&nbsp;discussion.</p><p>A discount function shows how the value of a good decreases if it occurs at different times. A particularly common form of discount function is exponential. In this case, the discount rate (in annualized form) is the percentage decrease in the value of a good, one year into the future, compared to now. So if you value a sweet in a year 20% less than having a sweet now, you are using a discount rate of&nbsp;20%.</p><p>It is generally thought that different discount functions should be used for different goods. This is because the reasons to discount apply to different extents for different goods. For instance, I might apply a lower discount rate for helping others than I do for myself, because it's more likely that (some) other people will be around in 60 years time than it is that I will still be alive in 60 years&nbsp;time.</p><p>Members of the effective altruism community have often argued against pure time discounting, and so for lower discounting of future welfare.

This is the intuition behind the idea that the work you do in your job is at least somewhat <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html\">replaceable</a>, as well as the reason to seek out do-gooding activities that aren&apos;t likely to be done without you.\n<h2>Perils of adding credit</h2>\nWe can get into tricky issues when trying to add up counterfactual credit, though. Let me give an example. Alice and Bob find themselves in a building that contains buttons. Each person is allowed to press only one button, at which point she/he is transported elsewhere and has no further access to the buttons. Thus, Alice and Bob want to maximize the effectiveness of their button pressing. There&apos;s a green button that, when pressed once, prevents 2 chickens from enduring life on a factory farm. There&apos;s also a red button that, when pressed twice in a row, prevents 3 chickens from enduring life on a factory farm. In order to make the red button effective, both Alice and Bob have to use their button press on it.<p></p><p>Alice goes first. Suppose she thinks it&apos;s very likely (say 99% likely) that Bob will press the red button. That means that if she presses the red button, she&apos;ll save 3 chickens, while if she presses the green button, she&apos;ll only save 2. There&apos;s more counterfactual credit for pressing the red button, so it seems she should do that. Then, Bob sees that Alice has pressed the red button. Now he faces the same comparison: If he presses red, he saves 3 chickens, while if he presses green, he saves only 2. He should thus press red. In this process, each person computed a counterfactual value of 3 for the red button vs. 2 for the green button. Added together, this implies a value of 3+3=6 vs. 2+2=4.</p><p>Unfortunately, in terms of the actual number of saved chickens, the comparison is 3 vs. 4. Both Alice and Bob should have pressed green to save 2+2=4 chickens. This shows that individual credit assignments can&apos;t just be added together naively.</p><p>Of course, the situation here depended on what Alice thought Bob would do. If Alice thought it was extremely likely Bob would press green, her counterfactual credit would have been 2 for green vs. 0 for red. Or, if she thought Bob would switch to red if and only if she pressed red, then the comparison was 2 for herself vs. 3-2=1 for Bob&apos;s switching to red and giving up his green.\n</p><h2>Joint decision analysis</h2>\nThe decision analysis becomes more clear using a payoff matrix as in game theory, except in this case both Alice and Bob, being altruists, share the same payoff, which is total chickens helped:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Bob press red</td>\n<td>Bob press green</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alice press red</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alice press green</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nAlice and Bob should coordinate to each press green. Of course, if Alice has pressed red, at that point Bob should as well.<p></p><p>In this example, reasoning based on <i>individual</i> counterfactual credit still works. Imagine that Alice was going to press red but was open to suggestions from Bob.

These people tend to start a bunch of discussions about their favored intervention, don&#x2019;t talk very much about anything else, and argue very forcefully for their point of view. This causes the community at large to ignore them, which is (understandably) upsetting: it seems hypocritical for the effective altruism community to claim to value a spirit of open-minded inquiry and then go around shunning outsiders who are arguing for a particular intervention.</p>\n<p>I think it&#x2019;s very important that we learn to talk to outsiders productively. And I largely understand where outsiders are coming from: from their perspective, the EA community looks like an amazing untapped resource they could be using for their preferred cause! And it&#x2019;s so amazing that they need to <em>push really hard</em> to mobilize it. Here&#x2019;s my attempt at explaining why that&#x2019;s a bad strategy, even though their intervention of choice is probably awesome.</p>\n<p>Right now the EA movement is very young. There are lots of interventions that seem promising, and there&#x2019;s not very much research on any of them. Even within the domain of global health and poverty, GiveWell has three interventions that it can&#x2019;t decide between, and they <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/12/why-givewell-labs/\">think</a> it&#x2019;s likely that global health isn&#x2019;t even the best option (just a good one that&#x2019;s easy to assess). When an organization as objective, rigorous, and thorough as GiveWell doesn&#x2019;t know which interventions will be the best, it makes us pretty skeptical of anyone else who claims to have certainty.</p>\n<p>Overall, there are four possible explanations for why such a person could disagree with what I&#x2019;ll call &#x201C;mainstream EA&#x201D; be really sure of an intervention.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>They have significantly different epistemological views from mainstream EA (I&#x2019;d say <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a> is an example of this, given their disagreement over <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">astronomical waste</a>);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they have significant information that mainstream EA thought doesn&#x2019;t (obviously I can&#x2019;t cite examples here);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they are avoiding significant biases that affect mainstream EAs (anti-aging research like <a href=\"http://www.sens.org/\">SENS</a> thinks it falls into this category);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they aren&#x2019;t actually engaging with the idea of effective altruism and are just trying to use the existence of a group of enthusiastic people for their own ends.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully, as an outsider think you belong to one of the first three. The problem is that the base rate of (4), as compared to the others, is <em>really high</em>, so you need a <em>ton</em> of evidence to outweigh that. And arguing repeatedly about your favored intervention actually isn&#x2019;t a good way to produce such evidence, since it&#x2019;s hard to make sufficiently persuasive arguments purely through text; furthermore, this plan is exactly what someone in (4) would come up with.</p>\n<p>Instead, the best kind of evidence that you fall into one of the first three categories would be trying to engage with the community on its own terms&#x2014;to cooperate in the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/9z/the_epistemic_prisoners_dilemma/\">epistemic prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma</a> that you and we fall into. For example, I was recently at the EA summit and Eliezer Yudkowsky (founder of MIRI) was also there. Honestly, I somewhat expected him to harp on AI risk for the whole conference. But even Eliezer was trying to contribute to EA thought on other topics&#x2014;see <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hvd/q_for_givewell_what_is_givedirectlys_mechanism_of/\">his new post on LessWrong</a> about <a href=\"http://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>. I think because he was willing to engage on other topics unrelated to AI risk, Eliezer actually ended up persuading more people about his views than he would have if he had soapboxed the entire time.</p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t mean to say that it&#x2019;s bad for outsiders to be enthusiastic about their intervention. Believing strongly in one thing can be a great motivator. (In fact, if you&#x2019;re very enthusiastic about getting EAs interested in something, maybe you could start doing some research of the type that GiveWell does on it! That would be super valuable.)

We saw <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections\">this idea</a> raised many times during the recent <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage\">press coverage</a> of <a href=\"/earning-to-give\">Earning to Give</a>. Our response is that although the objection may be true for <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/14/charity-isnt-about-helping/\">typical examples of philanthropy</a>, when donors are <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">giving effectively</a> it&#x2019;s difficult for the expected harm to outweigh the good done by the donations.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I make some very rough estimates of how harmful finance would have to be in order for it to outweigh the good done by the donations of someone Earning to Give to effective charities.</p>\n\n<h2>The Direct Harm</h2>\n<br>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<br>\n<p>Left leaning advocates sometimes claim that Bill Gates did more harm through the Windows monopoly than good through his charity work. On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.parapundit.com/archives/007256.html\">some on the right</a> claim that he did more good with Windows than with charity. Both views are implausible.</p>\n\n<p>I&#x2019;ll focus on the first claim, that the Windows monopoly did more harm than the Gates Foundation managed to do good, since this is the more common type of objection we find raised about Earning to Give. The vaccination programs of the Gates Foundation alone <a href=\"http://geekologie.com/2012/01/bill-gates-is-better-than-batman-the-inf.php\">are estimated</a> to have saved around 6 million lives to date, and this number is expected to rise significantly in the future. Windows has had <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2001697/Microsofts-Bill-Gates-A-rare-remarkable-interview-worlds-second-richest-man.html\">800 million</a> users to date. This means that in order for Gates to have caused more harm through Windows, using Windows would have to be worse than making a person in poverty play a 1-in-100 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette\">Russian roulette</a>. Microsoft might be annoying, but it&#x2019;s not that bad.</p>\n\n<h3>Zero-sum games</h3>\n<br>\n<p>What about other cases? It seems likely that many industries involve zero-sum elements, which use up human effort with creating value for society. For instance, it <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2011/11/18/closing-wall-streets-casino/\">has been claimed</a> that certain types of financial speculation are just gambling. One side wins and the other side loses. No value is created. Similarly with corporate law, escalating amounts of resources are spent aiming to win cases, when mutual disarmament might deliver the same results without enormous legal costs. In both cases, it&#x2019;s tough to show that these industries actually create no value. Some level of speculation leads to more efficient markets. Some level of competition is probably required in order to have a functioning legal system. Even if we assume that they indeed do not create any value, that is not a robust enough argument to show that pursuing a legal career and doing significant effective philanthropy is net harmful; in order to make this case, one would need to show that the industry is causing harm on a large scale. Here are some calculations to show roughly how large the harm would have to be for such a claim to be substantiated.</p>\n\n<h3>Harm outweighing the good in finance?</h3>\n<br>\n<h4>Estimate 1</h4>\n\n<p>Finance is often taken to be the legal high earning career that&#x2019;s most harmful to society. The average Goldman Sachs employee earns around <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-16/at-goldman-the-average-pay-for-3-months-is-135-594\">$500,000 per year</a>. If someone joined Goldman and donated half of his earnings to Against Malaria Foundation, that would be about enough to save <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved\">100 lives per year</a> (or more accurately, saving 4000 QALYs), plus likely have substantial positive <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>. For Earning to Give at Goldman to be net harmful, the marginal employee would need to be causing the death of a hundred people each year. This would mean that Goldman Sachs employees are several orders of magnitude more deadly than American service people in Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>Goldman has <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-16/at-goldman-the-average-pay-for-3-months-is-135-594\">32,000 employees</a>. An upper bound for the harm caused by the marginal employee is thus the total harm caused divided by 32,000. For the harm to outweigh the good, Goldman would therefore have to be killing at least 3.2 million young people each year, or doing something else that is similarly harmful. That would mean that Goldman Sachs would need to be responsible for around 5% of all deaths in the world. Bear in mind that Goldman Sachs only makes up <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563770\">22% of American investment banking</a>, and 3% of the American financial industry - if the rest of finance is similarly bad, then it would imply that finance is doing something as bad as causing <em>all</em> the deaths in the world.</p>\n\n<p>This is an upper bound, if we assume the Givewell estimate of cost per life saved won&#x2019;t go down, because (i) Goldman&#x2019;s activities will likely have some diminishing marginal returns (ii) there will be some level of replacement of Goldman employees. By (i), I mean that the 32,000th banker will have less impact than the rest of them. That&#x2019;s because the marginal bankers will have to take worse profit opportunities than the others, because the bankers will take the best opportunities first. If Goldman&#x2019;s harm is roughly proportional to its level of profit, then the marginal bankers will be much less harmful than the average banker. By (ii), I mean that if someone turns down a job at Goldman, Goldman <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/01/22/replaceability/\">will take some actions to compensate for that loss</a>, for instance they&#x2019;ll hire other people. This will probably result in a significant proportion of the harmful impact occurring anyway.</p>\n\n<h4>Estimate 2</h4>\n\n<p>Let&#x2019;s consider the American financial industry in general. Upcoming Giving What We Can research estimates that it would take $200 billion a year to move everyone in the world above the $1.25 poverty line. That figure will only be $74 billion in 2030. The employees of the financial sector could do this if they transferred (e.g. via GiveDirectly) 30-75% of their salaries to those in extreme global poverty (depending on what date you want to achieve the goal by). In other words, if everyone in finance were Earning to Give, it would be possible to end extreme global poverty within the next twenty years. Harm would only dominate if the financial sector is doing something roughly as bad as single handedly causing all global poverty.</p>\n\n<p>For an individual doing Earning to Give at the margin, the situation is even better, and the levels of harm would have to be even worse to get outweighing. They&#x2019;ll be doing less harm due to replaceability, and can do more good since they can pick better donation opportunities than would be available if that huge amount of money were being spent on aid.</p>\n\n<p>I find it implausible that finance is causing this much harm. The most strident critics of finance claim that the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/bankster-fraud-is-not-a-victimless-crime-it-has-driven-100-million-into-poverty-killing-millions.html\">financial crisis will result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and around 100 million extra in poverty</a>. The crisis is often regarded as the most harmful effect of the financial industry in recent times. But we&#x2019;ve shown that if everyone in the financial sector were doing Earning to Give, it could save millions of lives and move <em>everyone</em>out of extreme poverty - far greater positive impact than the harm done by the crisis. And (i) it&#x2019;s difficult to claim that the people in the financial sector were wholly responsible for the crisis (ii) we&#x2019;ve totally ignored any of the positive effects of finance. <a href=\"http://infoproc.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/against-finance.html\">This post</a> points out that the financial sector would only need to increase annual GDP growth by 0.1% in order to offset a financial crisis every twenty years that costs 15% of GDP.</p>\n\n<h2>Doing good in finance</h2>\n<br>\n<p>It may even be that many people pursuing Earning to Give in unethical industries have a net positive impact in their work. That&#x2019;s because bringing more ethically motivated people into finance seems likely to make it more socially beneficial.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to do is to create less harm than your less ethically motivated replacement. For that, it just needs to be possible to turn down some opportunities to do harm. For instance, much of the harm caused by finance in the last crisis seems to have come from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-tavakoli/fraud-as-a-business-model_b_950806.html\">fraudulent</a> activities in packaging mortage debt. If you were working in this sector, but didn&#x2019;t engage in (as much) fraud you could have reduced how bad it was. Of course, there would have been pressures on you to earn more, which may have made it difficult to avoid and keep your job, but it seems unlikely there was <em>nothing</em> you could have done. Alternatively, there seem to be <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CP%2B-%2BFinancial%2BInstability%2BFINISHED.pdf\">ways to reduce the harms of finance</a>. By advocating for these reforms from within, you might have some scope to improve finance from the inside.</p>\n\n<h3>The whistleblower escape hatch</h3>\n<br>\n<p>If you find yourself involved in something that&#x2019;s really harmful, then there&#x2019;s always the option to quit, and perhaps even to do some good on the way by becoming a whistleblower.</p>\n\n<p>There have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_whistleblowers\">been many whistleblowers</a> who have played a vital role in uncovering massive scandals. A recent financial example is Sherron Watkins, who played a major role in bringing down Enron.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In August 2001, Sherron Watkins, then Enron&#x2019;s vice president for corporate development, sent an explosive, seven-page email to the energy company&#x2019;s CEO, Kenneth Lay. She detailed what she called an &#x201D;<a href=\"https://umdrive.memphis.edu/jturner1/www/ACCT7241/Articles/Sherron%20Watkins%20eMail%20to%20Enron%20Chairman%20Kenneth%20Lay.pdf\">elaborate accounting hoax</a>,&#x201D; which included inflating income and hiding epic losses. Although Lay claimed that he&#x2019;d launch an investigation, Watkins said that she was immediately punished; her computer&#x2019;s hard drive was confiscated and her desk relocated to the nether regions of Enron. <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enron-files-for-bankruptcy\">Four months later</a>, Enron could no longer sustain the fraud, and it filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(quoting from <a href=\"http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2013/06/12/famous-whistle-blowers-snowden/#!slide=5954390\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>With whistleblowing, the more severe the harm being done in the industry, the more impact you have! Whistleblowers are rare and often have an outsized impact.</p>\n\n<h2>Other objections</h2>\n\n<h3>It&#x2019;s all signalling</h3>\n<br>\n<p>An alternative source of harm from doing Earning to Give is signalling your support for a harmful or suboptimal system. This could have an effect on the actions of others, which leads to negative effects, in particular, it makes it harder to fundamentally change the system.</p>\n\n<p>I think this effect is likely to be very small in most cases. First, I doubt many people will be strongly influenced if someone they know enters finance or law. It&#x2019;s a widely accepted path that lots of people already take, and they generally take it in order to get the large salary rather than because they were influenced by their friends.</p>\n\n<p>Second, it seems possible to mitigate the negative signalling (if you think this is an issue) by telling people &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t support the system, but I think that engaging with the system is currently the best way for me to make the world better.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<p>Third, doing Earning to Give has positive signalling effects too. In particular, you&#x2019;re promoting the ideas of (i) spending lots of your income to good causes rather than spending on it luxury goods and (ii) effective giving. These signals seem much stronger than the negative ones. We&#x2019;ve seen concrete examples of one person&#x2019;s donations leading to others.</p>\n\n<p>I expand on these effects more from section 5.3. of <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice\">this document</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Collective action</h3>\n<br>\n<p>A related worry is that considering Earning to Give might lead to a failure of collective action, in which lots of people end up propagating a system that is sub-optimal when a much better option was on the table. We address this objection <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/61-collective-action-working-in-unethical-industries-part-2\">here</a>. The quick answer is that only happens if effective altruists coordinate badly. As effective altruists become more numerous, it&#x2019;s seem far more likely that coordination will be good enough that they&#x2019;ll be able to solve these big problems, rather than get stuck in a situation where all the investment banks are filled with people doing Earning to Give but the system is unchanged.</p>\n\n<h3>Could you do more good elsewhere?</h3>\n<br>\n<p>An objection to Earning to Give that seems much more plausible is that taking a high earning job in order to donate more involves giving up an even better opportunity to do good. It&#x2019;s implausible that the harm done within high earning jobs is greater than the good done by effective donations, but it might be <em>even better</em> to work in a more socially beneficial job but donate less. For this to be true, the extra good you do in socially beneficial jobs (compared to non-beneficial high earning jobs) would have to be significantly larger than the good done by the extra donations you could make.</p>\n\n<p>We&#x2019;re highly uncertain about for which jobs this is the case. In the past, we have advised effective altruists with a particularly strong comparative advantage for earning money to go into Earning to Give, while we&#x2019;ve advised others to go into jobs that directly do good in <a href=\"/causes\">effective cause</a> areas.</p>\n\n<p>There may be other situations when it is better not to do Earning to Give. For instance, if you think boosting economic productivity is highly important, then it might be a mistake to swap entrepreneurship or engineering (which presumably increase society&#x2019;s wealth significantly) for finance or law (which presumably don&#x2019;t help nearly as much) in order to earn slightly more. We&#x2019;re planning to write more about this soon.</p>\n\n<p>All told, the question of who can make the most difference through Earning to Give seems very unsettled. See this post for some of the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/191-why-earning-to-give-is-often-not-the-best-option\">arguments against pursuing Earning to Give</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Thank you to Carl Shulman for providing comments on a draft and several of the examples.</em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"pg5MHgnpDWnnWDTyY":4},"voteCount":5,"baseScore":7,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000113,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-16T01:59:13.259Z","name":"Earning to give","slug":"earning-to-give","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Earning to give</strong> is the pursuit of a lucrative career with the purpose of donating a significant portion of the earnings to cost-effective organizations.</p><p>The value of earning to give may not be immediately obvious, since people tend to think of ethical jobs as those with a <i>direct</i> positive impact.

One such very common example is &quot;existential risk reduction&quot;, or attempts to make a long-term far future for humans more likely, say by reducing the chance of things that would cause human extinction.</p><p>I do agree that the far future is the most important thing to consider, by far (see papers by <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">Nick Bostrom</a> and <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research\">Nick Beckstead</a>). And I do think we can influence the far future. I just don&apos;t think we can do it in a <i>reliable</i> way. All we have are guesses about what the far future will be like and guesses about how we can affect it. All of these ideas are unproven, speculative projects, and I don&apos;t think they deserve the main focus of our funding.</p><p>While I waffled in cause indecision for a while, I&apos;m now going to resume donating to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell&apos;s top charities</a>, except when I have an opportunity to use a donation to learn more about impact. Why? My case is that speculative causes, or any cause with high uncertainty (reducing nonhuman animal suffering, reducing existential risk, etc.) requires that we rely on our commonsense to evaluate them with na&#x12B;ve cost-effectiveness calculations, and this is (1) demonstrably unreliable with a bad track record, (2) plays right into common biases, and (3) doesn&#x2019;t make sense based on how we ideally make decisions. While it&#x2019;s unclear what long-term impact a donation to a GiveWell top charity will have, the near-term benefit is quite clear and worth investing in.\n</p><h2>Focusing on Speculative Causes Requires Unreliable Commonsense</h2>\nHow can we reduce the chance of human extinction? It just makes sense that if we fund cultural exchange programs between the US and China, there will be more goodwill for the other within each country, and therefore the countries will be less likely to nuke each other. Since nuclear war would likely be very bad, it&apos;s of high value to fund cultural exchange programs, right?<p></p><p>Let&apos;s try another. The <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI) thinks that someday artificial intelligent agents will become better than humans at making AIs. At this point, AI will build a smarter AI which will build an even smarter AI, and -- FOOM! -- we have a superintelligence. It&apos;s important that this superintelligence be programmed to be benevolent, or things will likely be very bad. And we can stop this bad event by funding MIRI to <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/research/\">write more papers about AI</a>, right?</p><p>Or how about this one? It seems like there will be challenges in the far future that will be very daunting, and if humanity handles them wrong, things will be very bad. But if people were better educated and had more resources, surely they&apos;d be better at handling those problems, whatever they may be. Therefore we should focus on speeding up economic development, right?</p><p>These three examples are very common appeals to commonsense. But commonsense hasn&apos;t worked very well in the domain of finding optimal causes.\n</p><h3>Can you pick the winning social program?</h3>\nBenjamin Todd makes this point well in <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/66-social-interventions-gone-wrong\">&quot;Social Interventions Gone Wrong&quot;</a>, where he provides a quiz with eight social programs and asks readers to guess whether they succeeded or failed.<p></p><p><i>I&apos;ll wait for you to take the quiz first... doo doo doo... la la la...</i></p><p>Ok, welcome back. I don&apos;t know how well you did, but success on this quiz is very rare, and this poses problems for commonsense. Sure, I&apos;ll grant you that Scared Straight sounds pretty suspicious. But the Even Start Family Literacy Program? It just makes sense that providing education to boost literacy skills and promote parent-child literacy activities should boost literacy rates, right? Unfortunately, it was wrong. Wrong in a very counter-intuitive way. There wasn&apos;t an effect.\n</p><h3>GiveWell and Commonsense&apos;s Track Record of Failure</h3>\nCommonsense actually has a track record of failure. GiveWell has been talking about this for ages. Every time GiveWell has found an intervention hyped by commonsense notions of high-impact and they&apos;ve looked at it further, they&apos;ve ended up disappointed.<p></p><p><b>The first was the Fred Hollows Foundation.</b> A lot of people had been repeating the figure that the Fred Hollows Foundation could cure blindness for $50. But GiveWell found that number suspect.</p><p><b>The second was VillageReach.</b> GiveWell originally put them as their top charity and estimated them as <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/villagereach/December-2009-review#Whatdoyougetforyourdollar\">saving a life for under $1000</a>. But further investigation kept leading them to revise their estimate until ultimately they <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/07/26/rethinking-villagereachs-pilot-project/\">weren&apos;t even sure if VillageReach had an impact at all</a>.</p><p><b>Third, there is deworming.</b> Originally, deworming was announced as saving a year of healthy life (DALY) for every $3.41 spent. But when GiveWell dove into the spreadsheets that resulted in that number, they <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/29/errors-in-dcp2-cost-effectiveness-estimate-for-deworming/\">found five errors</a>. When the dust settled, the $3.41 figure was found to actually be off by a factor of 100. It was revised to $326.43.</p><p>Why shouldn&apos;t we expect this trend to not be the case in other areas where calculations are even looser and numbers are even less settled, like efforts devoted to speculative causes? Our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that are actually studied.\n</p><h3>People are notoriously bad at predicting the (far) future</h3>\nCost-effectiveness estimates also frequently require making predictions about the future. Existential risk reduction, for example, requires making predictions about what will happen in the far future, and how your actions are likely to effect events hundreds of years down the road. Yet, experts are notoriously bad at making these kinds of predictions.<p></p><p>James Shanteau found in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/074959789290064E\">&quot;Competence in Experts: The Role of Task Characteristics&quot;</a> (see also Kahneman and Klein&apos;s <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/64/6/515/\">&quot;Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree&quot;</a>) that experts perform well when thinking about static stimuli, thinking about things, and when there is feedback and objective analysis available. Furthermore, experts perform pretty badly when thinking about dynamic stimuli, thinking about behavior, and feedback and objective analysis are unavailable.</p><p>Predictions about existential risk reduction and the far future are firmly in the second category. So how can we trust our predictions about our impact on the far future? Our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that we can reliably predict, until we get better at prediction (or invest money in getting better at making predictions).\n</p><h3>Even broad effects require specific attempts</h3>\nOne potential resolution to this problem is to argue for &#x201C;broad effects&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;specific attempts&#x201D;. Perhaps it&#x2019;s difficult to know whether a particular intervention will go well or mistaken to focus entirely on Friendly AI, but surely if we improved incentives and norms in academic work to better advance human knowledge (meta-research), improved education, or advocated for effective altruism, the far future would be much better equipped to handle threats.<p></p><p>I agree that these broad effects would make the far future better and I agree that it&#x2019;s possible to implement these broad effects and change the far future. The problem, however, is it can&#x2019;t be done in an easy or well understood way. Any attempt to implement a broad effect would require a specific action that has an unknown expectation of success and unknown cost-effectiveness. It&#x2019;s definitely beneficial to advocate for effective altruism, but could this be done in a cost-effective way? A way that&#x2019;s more cost-effective at producing welfare than AMF? How would you know?</p><p>In order to accomplish these broad effects, you&#x2019;d need specific organizations and interventions to channel your time and money into. And by picking these specific organizations and interventions, you&#x2019;re losing the advantage of broad effects and tying yourself to particular things with poorly understood impact and no track record to evaluate.\n</p><h2>Focusing on speculative causes plays into our biases</h2>\nWe&apos;ve now known for quite a long time that people are not all that rational. Instead, human thinking fails in very predictable and systematic ways. Some of these ways make us less likely to take speculative causes seriously, such as ambiguity aversion, the absurdity heuristic, scope neglect, and overconfidence bias.<p></p><p>But there&#x2019;s also a different side of the coin, with biases that might make people think badly about existential risk:</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias\">Optimism bias</a>.</b> People generally think things will turn out better than they actually will. This could lead people to think that their projects will have a higher impact than they actually will, which would lead to higher estimates of cost-effectiveness than is reasonable.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control\">Control bias</a>.</b> People like to think they have more control over things than they actually do. This plausibly also includes control over the far future. Therefore, people are probably biased into thinking they have more control over the far future than they actually do, leading to higher estimates of ability to influence the future than is reasonable.</p><p><b>&quot;Wow factor&quot; bias.</b> People seem attracted to more impressive claims. Saving a life for $2500 through a malaria bed net seems much more boring compared to the chance of saving the entire world by averting a global catastrophe. Within the effective altruist / LessWrong community, existential risk reduction is cool and high status, whereas averting global poverty is not. This might lead to more endorsement of existential risk reduction than is reasonable.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy\">Conjunction fallacy</a>.</b> People have a problem assessing probability properly when there are many steps involved, each of which has a chance of not happening. Ten steps, each with an independent 90% success rate, has only a 35% chance of success. Focusing on the far future seems to involve that a lot of largely independent events happen the way that is predicted. This would mean people are worse at estimating their chances of helping the far future, creating higher cost-effectiveness estimates than is reasonable.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias\">Selection bias</a>.</b> When trying to find trends in history that are favorable for affecting the far future, some examples can be provided. However, this is because we usually hear about the interventions that end up working, whereas all the failed attempts to influence the far future are never heard of again. This creates a very skewed sample that can negatively bias our thinking about our success of influencing the far future.</p><p>It&#x2019;s concerning there are numerous biases both weighted in favor and weighted against speculative causes, and this means we must tread carefully when assessing their merits. However, I would strongly expect biases to be even worse in favor of speculative causes rather than against them, because speculative causes lack the available feedback and objective evidence needed to help insulate against bias, whereas a focus on global health does not.\n</p><h2>Focusing on speculative uses bad decision theory</h2>\nFurthermore, not only is the case for speculative causes undermined by a bad track record and possible cognitive biases, but the underlying decision theory seems suspect in a way that&apos;s difficult to place.\n<h3>Would you play a lottery with no stated odds?</h3>\nImagine another thought experiment -- you&apos;re asked to play a lottery. You have to pay $2 to play, but you have a chance at winning $100. Do you play?<p></p><p>Of course, you don&apos;t know, because you&apos;re not given odds. Rationally, it makes sense to play any lottery where you expect to come out ahead more often than not. If the lottery is a coin flip, it makes sense to pay $2 to have a 50/50 shot to win $100, since you&apos;d expect to win $50 on average, and come ahead $48 each time. With a sufficiently high reward, even a one in a million chance is worth it. Pay $2 for a 1/1M chance of winning $1B, and you&apos;d expect to come out ahead by $998 each time.</p><p>But $2 for the chance to win $100, without knowing what the chance is? Even if you had some sort of bounds, like you knew the odds had to be at least 1/150 and at most 1/10, though you could be off by a little bit. Would you accept that bet?</p><p>Such a bet seems intuitively uninviting to me, yet this is the bet that speculative causes offer me.\n</p><h3>&quot;Conservative orders of magnitude&quot; arguments</h3>\nIn response to these considerations, I&apos;ve seen people endorsing speculative causes look at their calculations and remark that even if their estimate were off by 1000x, or three orders of magnitude, they still would be on solid ground for high impact, and there&apos;s no way they&apos;re actually off by three orders of magnitude. However, Nate Silver&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/159420411X\"><b>The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail &#x2014; but Some Don&apos;t</b></a> offers a cautionary tale:\n<blockquote>Moody&#x2019;s, for instance, went through a period of making ad hoc adjustments to its model in which it increased the default probability assigned to AAA-rated securities by 50 percent. That might seem like a very prudent attitude: surely a 50 percent buffer will suffice to account for any slack in one&#x2019;s assumptions? It might have been fine had the potential for error in their forecasts been linear and arithmetic. But leverage, or investments financed by debt, can make the error in a forecast compound many times over, and introduces the potential of highly geometric and nonlinear mistakes.<p></p><p>Moody&#x2019;s 50 percent adjustment was like applying sunscreen and claiming it protected you from a nuclear meltdown&#x2014;wholly inadequate to the scale of the problem. It wasn&#x2019;t just a possibility that their estimates of default risk could be 50 percent too low: they might just as easily have underestimated it by 500 percent or 5,000 percent. In practice, defaults were two hundred times more likely than the ratings agencies claimed, meaning that their model was off by a mere 20,000 percent.</p></blockquote>\nSilver points out that when estimating how safe mortgage backed securities were, the difference between assuming defaults are perfectly uncorrelated and defaults are perfectly correlated is a difference of 160,000x in your risk estimate -- or five orders of magnitude.<p></p><p>If these kinds of five-orders-of-magnitude errors are possible in a realm that has actual feedback and is moderately understood, how do we know the estimates for cost-effectiveness are safe for speculative causes that are poorly understood and offer no feedback? Again, our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that we can reliably predict, until we get better at prediction.\n</p><h2>Value of information, exploring, and exploiting</h2>\nOf course, there still is one important aspect of this problem that has not been discussed -- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information\">value of information</a> -- or the idea that sometimes it&#x2019;s worth doing something just to learn more about how the world works. This is important in effective altruism too, where we focus specifically on &#x201C;giving to learn&#x201D;, or using our resources to figure out more about the impact of various causes.<p></p><p>I think this is actually really important and is not a victim to any of my previous arguments, because we&#x2019;re not talking about impact, but rather learning value. Perhaps one could look to an &#x201C;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit\">explore-exploit model</a>&#x201D;, or the idea that we achieve the best outcome when we spend a lot of time exploring first (learning more about how to achieve better outcomes) before exploiting (focusing resources on achieving the best outcome we can). Therefore, whenever we have an opportunity to &#x201C;explore&#x201D; further or learn more about what causes have high impact, we should take it.\n</p><h3>Learning in practice</h3>\nUnfortunately, in practice, I think these opportunities are very rare. Many organizations that I think are &#x201C;promising&#x201D; and worth funding further to see what their impact looks like do not have sufficiently good self-measurement in place to actually assess their impact or sufficient transparency to provide that information, therefore making it difficult to actually learn from them. And on the other side of things, many very promising opportunities to learn more are already fully funded. One must be careful to ensure that it&#x2019;s actually one&#x2019;s marginal dollar that is getting marginal information.\n<h3>The typical donor</h3>\nAdditionally, I don&#x2019;t think the typical donor is in a very good position to assess where there is high value of information or have the time and knowledge to act upon this information once it is acquired. I think there&#x2019;s a good argument for people in the &#x201C;effective altruist&#x201D; movement to perhaps make small investments in EA organizations and encourage transparency and good measurement in their operations to see if they&#x2019;re successfully doing what they claim (or potentially create an EA startup themselves to see if it would work, though this carries large risks of further splitting the resources of the movement).<p></p><p>But even that would take a very savvy and involved effective altruist to pull off. Assessing the value of information on more massive investments like large-scale research or innovation efforts would be significantly more difficult, beyond the talent and resources of nearly all effective altruists, and are probably left to full-time foundations or subject-matter experts.\n</p><h3>GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities also have high value of information</h3>\nAs Luke Muehlhauser mentions in <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hsd/start_under_the_streetlight_then_push_into_the/\">&#x201C;Start Under the Streetlight, Then Push Into the Shadows&#x201D;</a>, lots of lessons can be learned only by focusing on the easiest causes first, even if we have strong theoretical reasons to expect that they won&#x2019;t end up being the highest impact causes once we have more complete knowledge.<p></p><p>We can use global health cost-effectiveness considerations as practice for slowly and carefully moving into the more complex and less understood domains. There even are some very natural transitions, such as beginning to look at &#x201C;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow through effects</a>&#x201D; of reducing disease in the third-world and beginning to look at how more esoteric things affect the disease burden, like climate change. Therefore, even additional funding for GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities has high value of information. And notably, GiveWell is beginning this &#x201C;push&#x201D; through <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/category/givewell-labs/\">GiveWell Labs</a>.\n</p><h2>Conclusion</h2>\nThe bottom line is that sometimes things look too good to be true. Therefore, I should expect that the actual impact of speculative causes that make large promises, upon a thorough investigation, will be much lower.\nAnd this has been true in other domains. People are notoriously bad at estimating the effects of causes in both the developed world and developing world, and those are the causes that are near to us, provide us with feedback, and are easy to predict. Yet, from the Even Start Family Literacy Program to deworming estimates, our commonsense has failed us.<p></p><p>Add to that the fact that we should expect ourselves to perform even worse at predicting the far future. Add to that optimism bias, control bias, &quot;wow factor&quot; bias, and the conjunction fallacy, which make it difficult for us to think realistically about speculative causes. And then add to that considerations in decision theory, and whether we would bet on a lottery with no stated odds.</p><p>When all is said and done, I&apos;m very skeptical of speculative projects. Therefore, I think we should be focused on exploring and exploiting. We should do whatever we can to fund projects aimed at learning more, when those are available, but be careful to make sure they actually have learning value.

This form of longtermism was introduced by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/hilary-greaves\">Hilary Greaves</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/william-macaskill\">Will MacAskill</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4lqrm1tu6v4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4lqrm1tu6v4\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and has precedents in the work of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/nick-bostrom\">Nick Bostrom</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefijdcuqtcsja\"><sup><a href=\"#fnijdcuqtcsja\">[5]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrxubxlbto4l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrxubxlbto4l\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/nick-beckstead\">Nick Beckstead</a>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefohggtozamwg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnohggtozamwg\">[7]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1j6xqn8ih7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1j6xqn8ih7f\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and others. Note that the authors do not define or discuss \"weak\" longtermism; the contrast is rather with longtermism as such, which as noted above holds that positively influencing the long-term future is a key priority, but not necessarily the top priority.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"Patient_vs__urgent_longtermism\">Patient vs. urgent longtermism</h3><p>This distinction can be explained in reference to the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/hinge-of-history\">hinge of history hypothesis</a>, i.e. the hypothesis that we are currently living at a time where humanity has unusually high influence over the long-term future. Urgent longtermists find the hypothesis plausible and, accordingly, hold that it makes sense to spend our altruistic resources relatively quickly. (Altruistic resources include not just financial assets, but other resources that can accumulate and be spent deliberately in the pursuit of altruistic goals, such as credibility, career capital and coordination ability.) By contrast, patient longtermists hold that the opportunities for influence are not concentrated in the near term and, in line with this, they favour investing these resources so that they can be deployed at some point in the future, when the moments of significant influence arrive.</p><h3 id=\"Broad_vs__targeted_longtermism\">Broad vs. targeted longtermism</h3><p>This distinction was originally introduced by Nick Beckstead in his doctoral dissertation, <i>On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref73581e7p8q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn73581e7p8q\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Targeted (or narrow) longtermism attempts to positively influence the long-term future by focusing on specific, identifiable scenarios, such as the risks of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-risk\">misaligned AI</a> or an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/biosecurity\">engineered pandemic</a>. By contrast, broad longtermism tries to have a long-term influence by pursuing general approaches with the potential to be useful in a broader range of contexts, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/building-effective-altruism-1\">building effective altruism</a> or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-cooperation\">promoting global cooperation</a>.</p><p>Both patient and urgent longtermism, and broad and targeted longtermism, are positions that exist on a continuum. The terms \"urgent\"/\"patient\" and \"broad\"/\"targeted\" divide these continua into two discrete regions, similarly to how the terms \"tall\" and \"short\" divide the height continuum. These distinctions may thus be seen as uncovering an underlying dimension along which longtermism can vary. Accordingly, the more relevant questions are \"How patient/urgent should longtermism be?\" or \"How broad/targeted should longtermist interventions be?\", rather than \"Should longtermism be patient or urgent?\" or \"Should longtermism be targeted or narrow?\"</p><h3 id=\"Other_distinctions\">Other distinctions</h3><p>One additional distinction sometimes made—which also originates in Greaves and MacAskill—is between <i>axiological</i> and <i>deontic</i> longtermism. (\"Axiological\" and \"deontic\" are technical terms borrowed from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-philosophy\">moral philosophy</a>: \"axiological\" means \"related to what is good or valuable\" and \"deontic\" means \"related to what we ought to do or have reason to do\".) Axiological longtermism holds that positively influencing the long-term future is among the most valuable things we can do, whereas deontic longtermism holds that positively influencing the long-term future is among the things we have most reason to do. Sometimes these views are combined with strong longtermism, so axiological strong longtermism becomes the view that influencing the long-term future is the most valuable thing to do and deontic strong longtermism becomes the view that influencing the long-term future is the thing we have most reason to do.</p><p>Another relevant distinction, introduced by the philosophers Johan Gustafsson and Petra Kosonen, is between <i>normative</i> and <i>prudential</i> longtermism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9uksbqguhw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9uksbqguhw\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Normative longtermism is longtermism as it is normally understood, i.e. as a view about what is valuable, or we have reason to do, from an impersonal or moral perspective. However, one can also consider a form of longtermism focused on what is in a person's self-interest. If humans could live for thousands or millions of years, it could be argued that, even from a self-interested perspective, each person should focus primarily on the long-term effects of their actions, because a person's lifetime wellbeing will be largely determined by those effects.</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Balfour, Dylan (2021) <a href=\"https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2021/09/17/longtermism/\"><u>Longtermism: how much should we care about the far future?</u></a>, <i>1000-Word Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology</i>, September 17.</p><p>Beckstead, Nick (2019) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198841364.003.0006\">A brief argument for the overwhelming importance of shaping the far future</a>, in Hilary Greaves &amp; Theron Pummer (eds.) <i>Effective Altruism: Philosophical Issues</i>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 80–98.</p><p>MacAskill, William, Hilary Greaves &amp; Elliott Thornley (2021) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-9957281-8-9\">The moral case for long-term thinking</a>, in Natalie Cargill &amp; Tyler John (eds.) <i>The Long View: Essays on Policy, Philanthropy, and the Long-Term Future</i>, London: First, pp. 19–28.</p><p>Moorhouse, Fin (2021) <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism/\">Introduction to longtermism</a>, <i>Effective Altruism</i>, January 27.</p><p>Roser, Max (2022) <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/longtermism\"><u>The future is vast: longtermism’s perspective on humanity’s past, present, and future</u></a>, <i>Our World in Data</i>, March 15.</p><p>Todd, Benjamin (2017) <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/\"><u>Longtermism: the moral significance of future generations</u></a>, <i>80,000 Hours</i>, October.</p><p>Wikipedia (2021) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Longtermism&amp;oldid=1090541975\"><u>Longtermism</u></a>, <i>Wikipedia</i>, October 28 (updated 30 May 2022‎).</p><h2 id=\"External_links\">External links</h2><p><a href=\"https://longtermism.com/\">Longtermism</a>.

Good. But to which cause should you give?</p>\n<p>If you seek help from professional philanthropy advisers, the chances are that they won’t have much to say about this vital question. They will guide you, to be sure, through an array of charitable options. But the prevailing assumption in their field is that we shouldn’t, or perhaps can’t, make objective judgments about which options are better than others.</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130811191523/http://www.rockpa.org/\">Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors</a> , one of the world’s largest philanthropic service organizations. Its Web site offers a downloadable pamphlet with a chart showing areas to which a philanthropist might give: health and safety; education; arts, culture and heritage; human and civil rights; economic security; and environment. The Web site then asks, “What is the most urgent issue?” and answers by saying, “There’s obviously no objective answer to that question.”</p>\n<p>Is this true? I don’t think so. Compare, for instance, two of the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors’ categories: “health and safety” and “arts, culture and heritage.” To me it seems clear that there are objective reasons for thinking we may be able to do more good in one of these areas than in another.</p>\n<p>Suppose your local art museum is seeking funds to build a new wing to better display its collection. The museum asks you for a donation for that purpose. Let’s say that you could afford to give $100,000. At the same time, you are asked to donate to an organization seeking to reduce the incidence of trachoma, an eye disease caused by an infectious micro-organism that affects children in developing countries. Trachoma causes people to slowly lose their sight, typically culminating in their becoming blind between 30 and 40 years of age. It is preventable. You do some research and learn that each $100 you donate could prevent a person’s experiencing 15 years of impaired vision followed by another 15 years of blindness. So for $100,000 you could prevent 1,000 people from losing their sight.</p>\n<p>Given this choice, where would $100,000 do the most good? Which expenditure is likely to lead to the bigger improvement in the lives of those affected by it?</p>\n<p>On one side we have 1,000 people spared 15 years of impaired vision followed by 15 years of blindness, with all the ensuing problems that that would cause for poor people with no social security. What do we have on the other side?</p>\n<p>Suppose the new museum wing will cost $50 million, and over the 50 years of its expected usefulness, one million people will enjoy seeing it each year, for a total of 50 million enhanced museum visits. Since you would contribute 1/500th of the cost, you could claim credit for the enhanced aesthetic experiences of 100,000 visitors. How does that compare with saving 1,000 people from 15 years of blindness?</p>\n<p>To answer, try a thought experiment. Suppose you have a choice between visiting the art museum, including its new wing, or going to see the museum without visiting the new wing. Naturally, you would prefer to see it with the new wing. But now imagine that an evil demon declares that out of every 100 people who see the new wing, he will choose one, at random, and inflict 15 years of blindness on that person. Would you still visit the new wing? You’d have to be nuts. Even if the evil demon blinded only one person in every 1,000, in my judgment, and I bet in yours, seeing the new wing still would not be worth the risk.</p>\n<p>If you agree, then you are saying, in effect, that the harm of one person’s becoming blind outweighs the benefits received by 1,000 people visiting the new wing. Therefore a donation that saves one person from becoming blind would be better value than a donation that enables 1,000 people to visit the new wing. But your donation to the organization preventing trachoma will save not just one but 10 people from becoming blind for every 1,000 people it could provide with an enhanced museum experience. Hence a donation to prevent trachoma offers at least 10 times the value of giving to the museum.</p>\n<p>This method of comparing benefits is used by economists to judge how much people value certain states of affairs. It’s open to criticism because many people appear to have irrational attitudes toward the small risks of very bad things happening. (That’s why we need legislation requiring people to fasten their seat belts.) Still, in many cases, including the one we are now considering, the answer is clear enough.</p>\n<p>This is, of course, only one example of how we ought to choose between areas of philanthropy. Some choices are relatively easy and others are much more difficult. In general, where human welfare is concerned, we will achieve more if we help those in extreme poverty in developing countries, as our dollars go much further there. But the choice between, say, helping the global poor directly, and helping them, and all future generations, by trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, is more difficult. So, too, is the choice between helping humans and reducing the vast amount of suffering we inflict on nonhuman animals.</p>\n<p>But new developments are making these decisions easier. Until recently, it wasn’t even possible to find out which charities were the most effective within their own fields. Serious evaluation of charities helping people in extreme poverty began six years ago with the creation of the nonprofit charity evaluator <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130811191523/http://www.givewell.org/?gclid=CJOZtJvItLgCFdCZ4AodU2YAug\">GiveWell</a> .</p>\n<p>Now we can be highly confident that a donation to, for example, the Against Malaria Foundation will save lives and reduce the incidence of malaria, and that giving to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative will, at very low cost, reduce the incidence of neglected tropical diseases, especially those caused by parasites. More experimental is <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130811191523/http://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> , which will transfer at least 90 cents of every dollar you give to an extremely low-income African family. Initial studies show that these donations have long-term benefits for the recipients.</p>\n<p>“Effective altruism,” as this evidence-based approach to charity is known, is an emerging international movement. Not content with merely making the world a better place, its adherents want to use their talents and resources to make the biggest possible positive difference to the world. Thinking about which fields offer the most positive impact for your time and money is still in its infancy, but with more effective altruists researching the issues, we are starting to see real progress.</p>\n","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"eWH3tWCBbTnABLpxq":2,"ZLNgqQ4qdA6ztGXnb":2},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":4,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.00007832966165050453,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2021-12-01T07:46:04.495Z","name":"Review crosspost","slug":"review-crosspost","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>Use the <strong>review crosspost </strong>tag for posts that you cross-posted in order to make them eligible for the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jB7Ten8qmDszRMTho/effective-altruism-the-first-decade-forum-review\">Decade Review</a>.</p>","postCount":22,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"eWH3tWCBbTnABLpxq"},{"createdAt":"2021-01-23T15:47:18.726Z","name":"Peter Singer","slug":"peter-singer","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Peter Albert David Singer</strong> (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian philosopher, currently a professor of philosophy at Princeton University.

This post is meant to give a little explanation and update of what&#x2019;s been going on.</p><p>Motivated by a common concern over human activity-related risks to humanity, Lord Martin Rees, Professor Huw Price, and Jaan Tallinn founded the Centre for Study of Existential Risk last year. However, this announcement was made before the establishment of a physical research centre or securement of long-term funding. The last 9 months have been focused on turning an important idea into a reality.</p><p>Following the announcement in November, Professor Price contacted us at the Future of Humanity Institute regarding the possibility of collaboration on joint academic funding opportunities; the aim being both to raise the funds for CSER&#x2019;s research programmes and to support joint work by the FHI and CSER&#x2019;s researchers on anthropogenic existential risk. We submitted our first grant application in January to the European Research council &#x2013; an ambitious project to create &#x201C;A New Science of Existential Risk&#x201D; that, if successful, would provide enough funding for CSER&#x2019;s first research programme - a sizeable programme that will run for five years. We&#x2019;ve been successful in the first and second rounds, and we will hear a final round decision at the end of the year. It was also an opportunity for us to get some additional leading academics onto the project &#x2013; Sir Partha Dasgupta, Professor of Economics at Cambridge and an expert in social choice theory, sustainability and intergenerational ethics, is a co-PI (along with Huw Price, Martin Rees and Nick Bostrom). In addition, a number of prominent academics concerned about technology-related risk &#x2013; including Stephen Hawking, David Spiegelhalter, George Church and David Chalmers &#x2013; have joined our advisory board.</p><p>The FHI regards establishment of CSER as of the highest priority for a number of reasons including:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>The value of the research the Centre will engage in</li>\n\t<li>The reputational boost to the field of Existential Risk gained by the establishment of high-profile research centre in Cambridge.</li>\n\t<li>The impact on policy and public perception that academic heavy-hitters like Rees and Price can have</li>\n</ol>\nTherefore we&#x2019;ve been working with CSER behind the scenes over the last 9 months. Progress has been a little slow until now &#x2013; Huw, Martin and Jaan are fully committed to this project, but due to their other responsibilities aren&#x2019;t in a position to work full-time on it yet.<p></p><p>However, we&#x2019;re now in a position to make CSER&#x2019;s establishment official. Cambridge&#x2019;s new Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH) will host CSER and provide logistical support. I&#x2019;ll be acting manager of CSER&#x2019;s activities over the coming 6-12 months, under the guidance of Huw, Martin and Jaan. A generous seed funding donation from Jaan Tallinn is funding CSER&#x2019;s establishment and these activities &#x2013; which will include a lecture series, workshops, public outreach, and staff time on grant-writing and fundraising. It&#x2019;ll also provide a buyout of a fraction of my time from FHI (providing funds for us to hire part-time staff to offload some of the FHI workload and help with some of the CSER work).</p><p>At the moment and over the next couple of months we&#x2019;re going to be focused on identifying and working on additional academic funding opportunities for additional programmes, as well as chasing some promising leads in industry, private and philanthropic funding. I&#x2019;ll also be aiming to keep CSER&#x2019;s public profile active. There will be newsletters every three months (sign up <a href=\"http://cser.org/contact.html\">here</a>), the website&#x2019;s going to be fleshed out to contain more detail about our planned research and existing literature, and we&#x2019;ll be arranging regular high-quality media engagement. While we&#x2019;re unlikely to have time to answer every general query that comes in (though we&#x2019;ll try whenever possible: email: admin@cser.org), we&#x2019;ll aim to keep the existential risk community informed through the newsletters and posts such as these.</p><p>We&#x2019;ve been lucky to get a lot of support from the academic and existential risk community for the CSER centre. In addition to CRASSH, Cambridge&#x2019;s Centre for Science and Policy will provide support in making policy-relevant links, and may co-host and co-publicise events. We&#x2019;ve also received some very valuable advice and support from members of the effective altruism community.</p><p>From where I&#x2019;m sitting, CSER&#x2019;s successful launch is looking very promising.

Effective altruism has been discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">Peter Singer&#x2019;s TED talk</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\">Wikipedia</a>); this post gives our take on what it is and isn&#x2019;t.</p><p></p><h2>What is effective altruism?</h2>\nTo us, &#x201C;effective altruism&#x201D; means <strong>trying to do as much good as possible with each dollar and each hour that we have</strong>. It&#x2019;s a way of thinking about morality that insists on <em>maximization</em> of good accomplished, and not just <em>satisficing</em> of rules and guidelines. To us, this implies\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Focusing on how one&#x2019;s actions are likely to affect the world, rather than on how they affect oneself and one&#x2019;s feelings.</strong> Effective altruism is consistent with believing that giving benefits the giver, but it&#x2019;s not consistent with making this the driving goal of giving. Effective altruists often take pride in their willingness to give (either time or money) based on arguments that others might find too intellectual or abstract, and their refusal to give suboptimally even when a pitch is emotionally compelling. The primary/driving goal is to help others, not to feel good about oneself. (This doesn&#x2019;t mean that effective altruists aren&#x2019;t passionate about what they do or don&#x2019;t obtain emotional rewards; it means feeling this passion and obtaining these rewards comes from <em>focusing</em> on impact.)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Being open to working on any cause, rather than committing to a cause up-front based on pre-existing personal interests.</strong> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\">Strategic cause selection</a> is based on the notion that one can do much more good working on some issues than on others.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thinking of all beliefs as being open to change, and therefore potentially worthy of debate and analysis.</strong> Effective altruists research and debate a broad range of topics, from <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/\">estimates of how to improve lives as much as possible per dollar</a> to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">how such estimates should be used</a> to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/04/deep-value-judgments-and-worldview-characteristics/\">what counts as a life</a> to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/\">whether it&#x2019;s better to give now or later</a> (and many more). The consequences of a shift in views &#x2013; including on relatively abstract topics &#x2013; can be large, so one should not take any questions &#x201C;off the table&#x201D; by declaring that only one answer is acceptable.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Being open to unconventional approaches to doing good.</strong> For example, effective altruists often choose to devote themselves to for-profit activities, perhaps because they&#x2019;re <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/26/our-take-on-earning-to-give/\">earning to give</a> and perhaps because they believe these activities are <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">themselves promising ways to improve the world</a>. Doing lucrative for-profit work isn&#x2019;t usually &#x2013; or stereotypically &#x2013; identified with being &#x201C;humanitarian&#x201D; or &#x201C;altruistic,&#x201D; but for effective altruists it can be a serious option.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Using one&#x2019;s investigative resources efficiently.</strong> We&#x2019;ll never have all the information we need to make knowably optimal decisions. Effective altruism means focusing one&#x2019;s debates, analysis and research on questions that will bear tangible fruit in terms of informing our decisions about how to accomplish good.\n<div>Different groups in the movement have different views of what this means. Some believe it is important to focus on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/04/deep-value-judgments-and-worldview-characteristics/\">philosophical questions</a> (such as &#x201C;should we value enabling a birth similarly to averting a death?&#x201D;) that seem in some sense &#x201C;fundamental&#x201D; and highly consequential in determining what outcomes we should aim for. We take a different view: we believe that questions like these, important though they may be, often aren&#x2019;t amenable to tangible progress through further investigation. We prefer to focus our resources on questions that combine &#x201C;importance&#x201D; with &#x201C;tractability to further investigation.&#x201D;</div></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Effective altruism is unusual and controversial</h2>\nTo many readers of this blog, the above qualities might sound like self-evidently good ones. But we don&#x2019;t believe that&#x2019;s how most people see them.<p></p><p>As GiveWell and Good Ventures have <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\">explored what causes to get involved in</a>, the single most common advice we&#x2019;ve gotten has been to &#x201C;choose what you&#x2019;re passionate about.&#x201D; When we&#x2019;ve described our desire to do &#x201C;strategic cause selection&#x201D; &#x2013; choosing causes based on how we can accomplish the most good &#x2013; we&#x2019;ve seen a good deal of pushback and skepticism. It&#x2019;s common for people to emphasize the importance of &#x201C;starting from the heart,&#x201D; and to fear that our commitment to a cause won&#x2019;t be genuine (and won&#x2019;t be robust) if it comes from a strategic, analysis-based choice.</p><p>This concern is reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=0\">David Brooks&#x2019;s reaction to the idea of &#x201C;earning to give&#x201D;:</a>\n</p><blockquote>If you choose a profession that doesn&#x2019;t arouse your everyday passion for the sake of serving instead some abstract faraway good, you might end up as a person who values the far over the near. You might become one of those people who loves humanity in general but not the particular humans immediately around &#x2026; Instead of seeing yourself as one person deeply embedded in a particular community, you may end up coolly looking across humanity as a detached god.<p></p><p>&#x2026;when most people pick a vocation, they don&#x2019;t only want one that will be externally useful. They want one that they will enjoy, and that will make them a better person. They want to find that place, as the novelist Frederick Buechner put it, &#x201C;where your deep gladness and the world&#x2019;s deep hunger meet.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>\nI believe that these concerns misunderstand effective altruism. Effective altruism isn&#x2019;t an alternative to having personal interests and passions; it <em>is</em> a personal interest and passion. Our next post will elaborate.<p></p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/13/effective-altruism/\">The GiveWell Blog</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":3,"baseScore":6,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000089,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"tXoE6wrEQv7GoDivb","postedAt":"2013-08-19T21:07:57.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Preventing human extinction","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2015-11-13T17:12:14.560Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tXoE6wrEQv7GoDivb/preventing-human-extinction","htmlBody":"<html><body><p><em><strong>Co-authored by Nick Beckstead, Peter Singer, and Matt Wage</strong></em></p><p>Many scientists believe that a large asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Could humans face the same fate?</p><p>It&#x2019;s a possibility. NASA has tracked most of the large nearby asteroids and many of the smaller asteroids. If a large asteroid were found to be on a collision course with Earth, that could give us time to deflect the asteroid. NASA has analyzed multiple options for deflecting an asteroid in this kind of scenario, including using a nuclear strike to knock the asteroid off course, and it seems that some of these strategies would be likely to work. The search is, however, not yet complete. The new B612 foundation has recently begun a project to track the remaining asteroids in order to &#x201C;protect the future of civilization on this planet.&#x201D; Finding one of these asteroids could be the key to preventing a global catastrophe.</p><p>Fortunately, the odds of an extinction-sized asteroid hitting the earth this century are low, on the order of one in a million. Unfortunately, asteroids aren&#x2019;t the only threats to humanity&#x2019;s survival. Other potential threats stem from bio-engineered diseases, nuclear war, extreme climate change, and dangerous future technologies.</p><p>Given that there is some risk of humanity going extinct over the next couple of centuries, the next question is whether we can do anything about it. We will first explain what we can do about it, and then ask the deeper ethical question: how bad would human extinction be?</p><p>The first point to make here is that if the risks of human extinction turn out to be &#x201C;small,&#x201D; this shouldn&#x2019;t lull us into complacency. No sane person would say, &#x201C;Well, the risk of a nuclear meltdown at this reactor is only 1 in 1000, so we&#x2019;re not going to worry about it.&#x201D; When there is some risk of a truly catastrophic outcome and we can reduce or eliminate that risk at an acceptable cost, we should do so. In general, we can measure how bad a particular risk is by multiplying the probability of the bad outcome by how bad the outcome would be. Since human extinction would, as we shall shortly argue, be extremely bad, reducing the risk of human extinction by even a very small amount would be very good.</p><p>Humanity has already done some things that reduce the risk of premature extinction. We&#x2019;ve made it through the cold war and scaled back our reserves of nuclear weapons. We&#x2019;ve tracked most of the large asteroids near Earth. We&#x2019;ve built underground bunkers for &#x201C;continuity of government&#x201D; purposes, which might help humanity survive certain catastrophes. We&#x2019;ve instituted disease surveillance programs that track the spread of diseases, so that the world could respond more quickly in the event of a large-scale pandemic. We&#x2019;ve identified climate change as a potential risk and developed some plans for responding, even if the actual response so far has been lamentably inadequate. We&#x2019;ve also built institutions that reduce the risk of extinction in subtler ways, such as decreasing the risk of war or improving the government&#x2019;s ability to respond to a catastrophe.</p><p>One reason to think that it is possible to further reduce the risk of human extinction is that all these things we&#x2019;ve done could probably be improved. We could track more asteroids, build better bunkers, improve our disease surveillance programs, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, encourage non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and strengthen world institutions in ways that would probably further decrease the risk of human extinction. There is still a substantial challenge in identifying specific worthy projects to support, but it is likely that such projects exist.</p><p>So far, surprisingly little work has been put into systematically understanding the risks of human extinction and how best to reduce them. There have been a few books and papers on the topic of low-probability, high-stakes catastrophes, but there has been very little investigation into the most effective methods of reducing these risks. We know of no in-depth, systematic analysis of the different strategies for reducing these risks. A reasonable first step toward reducing the risk of human extinction is to investigate these issues more thoroughly, or support others in doing so.</p><p>If what we&#x2019;ve said is correct, then there is some risk of human extinction and we probably have the ability to reduce this risk. There are a lot of important related questions, which are hard to answer: How high a priority should we place on reducing the risk of human extinction? How much should we be prepared to spend on doing so? Where does this fit among the many other things that we can and should be doing, like helping the global poor? (On that, see www.thelifeyoucansave.com) Does the goal of reducing the risk of extinction conflict with ordinary humanitarian goals, or is the best way of reducing the risk of extinction simply to improve the lives of people alive today and empower them to solve the problem themselves?</p><p>We won&#x2019;t try to address those questions here. Instead, we&#x2019;ll focus on this question: How bad would human extinction be?</p><p>One very bad thing about human extinction would be that billions of people would likely die painful deaths. But in our view, this is, by far, not the worst thing about human extinction. The worst thing about human extinction is that there would be no future generations.</p><p>We believe that future generations matter just as much as our generation does. Since there could be so many generations in our future, the value of all those generations together greatly exceeds the value of the current generation.</p><p>Considering a historical example helps to illustrate this point. About 70,000 years ago, there was a supervolcanic eruption known as the Toba eruption. Many scientists believe that this eruption caused a &#x201C;volcanic winter&#x201D; which brought our ancestors close to extinction. Suppose that this is true. Now imagine that the Toba eruption had eradicated humans from the earth. How bad would that have been? Some 3000 generations and <a href=\"http://www.prb.org/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx\">100 billion lives later</a>, it is plausible to say that the death and suffering caused by the Toba eruption would have been trivial in comparison with the loss of all the human lives that have been lived from then to now, and everything humanity has achieved since that time.</p><p>Similarly, if humanity goes extinct now, the worst aspect of this would be the opportunity cost. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. Yet Earth could remain habitable for another billion years. And if it is possible to colonize space, our species may survive much longer than that.</p><p>Some people would reject this way of assessing the value of future generations. They may claim that bringing new people into existence cannot be a benefit, regardless of what kind of life these people have. On this view, the value of avoiding human extinction is restricted to people alive today and people who are already going to exist, and who may want to have children or grandchildren.</p><p>Why would someone believe this? One reason might be that if people never exist, then it can&#x2019;t be bad for them that they don&#x2019;t exist. Since they don&#x2019;t exist, there&#x2019;s no &#x201C;them&#x201D; for it to be bad for, so causing people to exist cannot benefit them.</p><p>We disagree. We think that causing people to exist can benefit them. To see why, first notice that causing people to exist can be bad for those people. For example, suppose some woman knows that if she conceives a child during the next few months, the child will suffer from multiple painful diseases and die very young. It would obviously be bad for her child if she decided to conceive during the next few months. In general, it seems that if a child&#x2019;s life would be brief and miserable, existence is bad for that child.</p><p>If you agree that bringing someone into existence can be bad for that person and if you also accept the argument that bringing someone into existence can&#x2019;t be good for that person, then this leads to a strange conclusion: being born could harm you but it couldn&#x2019;t help you. If that is right, then it appears that it would be wrong to have children, because there is always a risk that they will be harmed, and no compensating benefit to outweigh the risk of harm.</p><p>Pessimists like the nineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, or the contemporary South African philosopher David Benatar accept this conclusion. But if parents have a reasonable expectation that their children will have happy and fulfilling lives, and having children would not be harmful to others, then it is not bad to have children. More generally, if our descendants have a reasonable chance of having happy and fulfilling lives, it is good for us to ensure that our descendants exist, rather than not. Therefore we think that bringing future generations into existence can be a good thing.</p><p>The extinction of our species &#x2013; and quite possibly, depending on the cause of the extinction, of all life - would be the end of the extraordinary story of evolution that has already led to (moderately) intelligent life, and which has given us the potential to make much greater progress still. We have made great progress, both moral and intellectual, over the last couple of centuries, and there is every reason to hope that, if we survive, this progress will continue and accelerate. If we fail to prevent our extinction, we will have blown the opportunity to create something truly wonderful: an astronomically large number of generations of human beings living rich and fulfilling lives, and reaching heights of knowledge and civilization that are beyond the limits of our imagination.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"ee66CtAMYurQreWBH":2,"MY2hgLkhKPj2bb3tj":2},"voteCount":10,"baseScore":17,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000161,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-28T05:56:21.918Z","name":"Existential risk","slug":"existential-risk","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>An <strong>existential risk</strong> is the risk of an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/existential-catastrophe-1\">existential catastrophe</a>, i.e. one that threatens the destruction of humanity’s longterm potential.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0f5x8s34vee\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0f5x8s34vee\">[1]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs39fj4bj7yr\"><sup><a href=\"#fns39fj4bj7yr\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Existential risks include <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/natural-existential-risk\">natural risks</a> such as those posed by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/asteroids\">asteroids</a> or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/supervolcano\">supervolcanoes</a> as well as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/anthropogenic-existential-risks\">anthropogenic risks</a> like mishaps resulting from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/global-catastrophic-biological-risk\">synthetic biology</a> or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/ai-risk\">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>A number of authors have argued that existential risks are especially important because the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/longtermism\">long-run future of humanity</a> matters a great deal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0f5x8s34vee\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0f5x8s34vee\">[1]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefehnudz7v1f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnehnudz7v1f\">[3]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx1zw0p7aful\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx1zw0p7aful\">[4]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxep7ip80wm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxep7ip80wm\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Many believe that there is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/temporal-discounting\">no intrinsic moral difference</a> between the importance of a life today and one in a hundred years.

They worry that we therefore won’t be fully engaged in, or committed to, the causes we pick.</p><p>I think such people fundamentally misunderstand effective altruism. I think they imagine that we have passions for particular causes, and are trying to submerge our passions in the service of rationality. That isn’t the case. Rather, <strong>effective altruism is what we are passionate about</strong>. We’re excited by the idea of making the most of our resources and helping others as much as possible.</p><p>This post focuses on my own attitude toward effective altruism, though I believe it is broadly shared by many others in the movement.</p><p>In a nutshell: trying to maximize the good I accomplish with both my hours and my dollars is an intellectually engaging challenge. It makes my life feel more meaningful and more important. It’s a way of trying to have an impact and significance beyond my daily experience. In other words, it meets the sort of non-material needs that many people have.</p><h3>Effective altruism does not prioritize intellect over emotion</h3><p>When considering which particular causes I find interesting, I can’t answer the question “How excited am I about the cause?” without asking questions like “How important is the cause?” and “Is it already crowded with other funders?” Throughout my life, how excited I’ve been to work on a problem has been directly related to how “neglected” the problem seems (relative to its importance). I’d have trouble sustaining interest in a cause if I felt that I could do more good by switching to another.</p><p>I’m not describing how I “should” think or “try to” think. I’m describing what excites me. The causes I find most under-invested in, and the general process of finding them, is what gets me out of bed in the morning, excited to go to work. This excitement is what drove the all-nighters that started GiveWell, and I believe I couldn’t be as motivated or put in as much effort on any other project.</p><h3>Effective altruism is not about sacrifice</h3><p>I’m always a bit put off when I see effective altruists being characterized as “selfless” or “sacrificing.” Speaking for myself and Elie [Hassenfeld, co-founder of GiveWell]: We don’t consider ourselves unusually “selfless,” and there has been no sacrifice whatsoever involved in our starting GiveWell. Compared to when we worked in finance, we find our work more interesting, more exciting, more motivating, and better for meeting people whom we have strong connections with, all of which easily makes up for pay cuts that haven’t much affected our lifestyles. I can’t speak for people like <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/\"><u>Jason Trigg</u></a> or <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\"><u>Julia Wise and Jeff Kaufman</u></a>, but <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/cheerfully.html\">Julia Wise’s <u>most recent post</u></a> implies that she sees altruism as a source of joy, not something for which joy is traded.</p><p>To anyone who’s tempted to respond, “I just don’t believe that people can get excited about something like that,” I’d respond that there is a very wide range of things people are known to get excited about, many of which seem strange to outsiders. This is true of casual interests (bird-watching, stamp-collecting, spectator sports, fantasy sports) and of more serious interests, including a very wide variety of religious and spiritual values and practices.&nbsp;</p><p>Some see effective altruism as more like a hobby, while others see it as more like a religious or spiritual value (or as implied by their religious or spiritual values); in all cases, effective altruists are engaging in the very common practice of having an interest that goes beyond their everyday lives and immediate needs. There’s absolutely nothing unusual about caring a great deal about such an interest; giving up some tangible things for the sake of such an interest; and using intellectual reasoning in pursuing such an interest.</p><p>Athletes sometimes talk about “giving 110%” or “leaving it all on the field” – they can’t be satisfied with their effort if they feel they held anything back. I feel similarly about <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\"><u>strategic cause selection</u>.</a> If I passed up an opportunity to do good because it didn’t appeal to my pre-existing personal interests, or because it involved too much abstract reasoning, I’d feel as though I’d failed to “leave it all on the field.”</p><p>Note that this doesn’t mean I’m willing to give up everything else I value and enjoy for effective altruism — I’m not. But when I’m engaged in altruism-oriented activities, I want to be fully engaged.</p><h3>I expect the effective altruism movement to grow</h3><p>So far, I’ve been somewhat surprised at how few people seem to share my interest in effective altruism. Many people want to help others, and many apply a great deal of both intellect and passion to doing so, but few seem to be asking the question: “What issue should I work on in order to have as much positive impact as possible?”</p><p>But my guess is that more people will be asking this question as time goes on. I believe that there are fairly robust trends in each of the following areas:</p><ul><li>The world is becoming wealthier. More of us are securely able to satisfy our own material needs.</li><li>The world is becoming more unequal. The differences between the privileged and the disadvantaged are reaching <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/\"><u>levels that seem to compel action</u></a>.</li><li>The world is getting better at transmitting information. More than ever before, we have the tools to learn just how privileged we are, to learn what actions are available to us, to sort through the available information, and to make informed decisions. We also have the tools to transfer our resources across the world with high efficiency and precision.</li></ul><p>Today, anyone with a spare $100 has the ability to learn how <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/\"><u>relatively fortunate they are</u></a>, to learn about their many options for making a difference, and to take truly meaningful and impactful action. In such a world, I expect a growing number of people to be asking the question “How can I make the most of this opportunity?” And I hope they’ll ask it not from a place of guilt and obligation, but from a place of self-actualization and excitement.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"oeJfrABw8ZjvB2DkB":2,"Y58JXAG3TYRFphwyf":1},"voteCount":9,"baseScore":17,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000143,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-11-16T07:32:11.855Z","name":"Motivational","slug":"motivational","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>Motivational</strong> tag covers posts that focus on inspiring us to do good (either a specific kind of good, or whatever we already want to work on).</p><p>We hope that reading through this collection will lift your spirits and spur you to beneficial action!</p><p>If a post motivates you to do good, or you think it will motivate others, upvote it.

By contrast, excited altruism stresses that being able to make a significant difference in the life of others is an exciting opportunity.

Would he go and work at the soup kitchen, even though he would do much more good if he continued to work at GiveWell? In response Holden said he found it difficult to engage with a hypothetical question that involved such a fundamental transformation, but added, “I would have a tough decision and would have a real chance of opting for the soup kitchen.” Why, though, is this even a tough decision? Why does Holden not say simply, “Yes, of course, then I would work at the soup kitchen”? Because, I suggest, reason is playing a role in his decision making, as it should.</p></blockquote><p>Excited and obligatory altruism, however, need not be mutually exclusive: one may regard the prospect of improving the lives of others as both a moral obligation and an exciting opportunity. Nor are these two perspectives jointly exhaustive. Nate Soares rejects obligatory altruism because \"guilt and shame are poor motivators, and that self-imposed obligations are often harmful\", but he also rejects excited altruism because \"Lives hang in the balance. The entire future hangs in the balance.

In this post I want to briefly discuss what I see as the most important impacts of AI. I think these impacts are the heavy hitters by a solid margin; each of them seems like a big deal, and I think there is a big gap to&nbsp;#4.</p><ol><li>Growth will accelerate, probably very significantly. Growth rates will likely rise by at least an order of magnitude, and probably further, until we run into severe resource constraints. Just as the last 200 years have experienced more change than 10,000 BCE to 0 BCE, we are likely to see periods of 4 years in the future that experience more change than the last&nbsp;200.</li><li>Human wages will fall, probably very far. When humans work, they will probably be improving other humans’ lives (for example, in domains where we intrinsically value service by humans) rather than by contributing to overall economic productivity. The great majority of humans will probably not work. Hopefully humans will remain relatively rich in absolute&nbsp;terms.</li><li>Human values won’t be the only thing shaping the future. Today humans trying to influence the future are the only goal-oriented process shaping the trajectory of society. Automating decision-making provides the most serious opportunity yet for that to change. It may be the case that machines make decisions in service of human interests, that machines share human values, or that machines have other worthwhile values. But it may also be that machines use their influence to push society in directions we find uninteresting or less&nbsp;valuable.</li></ol><p>My guess is that the first two impacts are relatively likely, that there is unlikely to be a strong enough regulatory response to prevent them, and that their net effects on human welfare will be significant and positive. The third impact is more speculative, probably negative, more likely to be prevented by coordination (whether political regulation, coordination by researchers, or something else), and also I think more important on a long-run humanitarian&nbsp;perspective.</p><p>None of these changes are likely to occur in discrete jumps. Growth has been accelerating for a long time. Human wages have stayed high for most of history, but I expect them to begin to fall (probably unequally) long before everyone becomes unemployable. Today we can already see the potential for firms to control resources and make goal-oriented decisions in a way that no individual human would, and I expect this potential to increase continuously with increasing&nbsp;automation.</p><p>Most of this discussion is not particularly new. The first two ideas feature prominently in Robin Hanson’s speculation about an economy of human emulations (alongside many other claims); many of the points below I picked up from Carl Shulman; most of them are much older. I’m writing this post here because I want to collect these thoughts in one place, and I want to facilitate discussions that separate these impacts from each other and analyze them in a more meaningful&nbsp;way.</p><h2><strong>Growth will accelerate</strong></h2><p>There are a number of reasons to suspect that automation will eventually lead to much faster growth. By “much faster growth” I mean growth, and especially intellectual progress, which is at least an order of magnitude faster than in the world of&nbsp;today.</p><p>I think that avoiding fast growth would involve solving an unprecedented coordination problem, and would involve large welfare losses for living people. I think this is very unlikely (compare to environmental issues today, which seem to have a lower bar for coordination, smaller welfare costs to avert, and clearer&nbsp;harms).</p><h3><strong>Automating tech progress leads to fast&nbsp;growth</strong></h3><p>The stereotyped story goes: “If algorithms + hardware to accomplish X get 50% cheaper with each year of human effort, then they’ll also (eventually) get 50% cheaper with each year of AI effort. But then it will only take 6 months to get another 50% cheaper, 3 months to get another 50% cheaper, and by the end of the year the rate of progress will be&nbsp;infinite.”</p><p>In reality things are very unlikely to be so simple, but the basic conclusion seems quite plausible. It also lines up with the predictions of naive economic models, on which constant returns to scale (with fixed tech) + endogenously driven technology — &gt; infinite returns in finite&nbsp;time.</p><p>Of course the story breaks down as you run into diminishing returns to intellectual effort, and once “cheap” and “fast” diverge. But based on what we know now it looks like this breakdown should only occur very far past human level (this could be the subject for a post of its own, but it looks like a pretty solid prediction). So my money would be on a period of fast progress which ends only once society looks unrecognizably&nbsp;different.</p><p>One complaint with this picture is that technology already facilitates more tech progress, so we should be seeing this process underway already. But we do see accelerating growth (see the section on the historical record, below), except for a historically brief period of 50–75 years. So this seems like a weak&nbsp;objection.</p><h3><strong>Substituting capital for labor leads to fast&nbsp;growth</strong></h3><p>Even if we hold fixed the level of technology, automating human labor would lead to a decoupling of economic growth from human reproduction. Society could instead grow at the rate at which robots can be used to produce more robots, which seems to be much higher than the rate at which the human population grows, until we run into resource constraints (which would be substantially reduced by a reduced dependence on the&nbsp;biosphere).</p><h3><strong>Extrapolating the historical record suggests fast&nbsp;growth</strong></h3><p>Over the course of history the proportional rate of growth has increased substantially, from more than 1,500 years per doubling around 10k years ago, to around 150 years per doubling in the 17th century, to around 15 years per doubling in the 20th century. A reasonable extrapolation of the pre-1950 data appears to suggest an asymptote with infinite population sometime in the 21st century. The last 50 years represent a notable departure from this trend, although history has seen similar periods of relative&nbsp;stagnation.</p><p>(See the graph below, produced from Bradford Delong’s data <a href=\"https://www.bradford-delong.com/2014/05/estimates-of-world-gdp-one-million-bc-present-1998-my-view-as-of-1998-the-honest-broker-for-the-week-of-may-24-2014.html\">here</a>; data and full size <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mn9q6_6tcYPknoe09gd0PMtQmyV2W7Z-yMGXZIJ86ow/edit#gid=2145687551\">here</a>. The graph starts at a doubling time of 8000 years, and plateaus around 25 years, about 300 times faster. The average time required for growth rates to double is about 1.5 doublings, or 40 years at the current rate. Each subsequent doubling of the growth rate takes half as&nbsp;long.)</p><p>I don’t think that extrapolating this trend forward results in particularly robust or even meaningful predictions, but I do think it says one thing: we shouldn’t be surprised by a future with much faster growth. The knee jerk response of “that seems weird” is inconsistent with the actual history (though it is a very reasonable intuitive reaction for someone who lived through the 2nd half of the 20th century). The more recent trend of slow growth may well continue, but I don’t think we should be surprised if this stagnation was a temporary departure from trend, comparable to previous departures in severity and&nbsp;scale.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4TahoCPeSc68ICw8isqWSS/841b346f304ce02c78bf6162b9de1d95/three_impacts.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4TahoCPeSc68ICw8isqWSS/841b346f304ce02c78bf6162b9de1d95/three_impacts.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4TahoCPeSc68ICw8isqWSS/841b346f304ce02c78bf6162b9de1d95/three_impacts.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4TahoCPeSc68ICw8isqWSS/841b346f304ce02c78bf6162b9de1d95/three_impacts.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4TahoCPeSc68ICw8isqWSS/841b346f304ce02c78bf6162b9de1d95/three_impacts.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4TahoCPeSc68ICw8isqWSS/841b346f304ce02c78bf6162b9de1d95/three_impacts.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4TahoCPeSc68ICw8isqWSS/841b346f304ce02c78bf6162b9de1d95/three_impacts.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><h2><strong>Wages will fall</strong></h2><p>I think this is the most robust of the three predictions. It seems very likely that eventually machines will be able to do all of the things that a human can do, as well as a human can do it. At that point, it would require significant coordination to prevent the broad adoption of machines as human replacements. Moreover, continuing to use human labor in this scenario seems socially undesirable; if we don’t have to work it seems crazy to make work for ourselves, and failing to make use of machine labor would involve even more significant sacrifices in&nbsp;welfare.</p><p>(Humans may still demand other humans’ labor in distinctively human roles. And there may be other reasons for money to move around between humans. But overall most new valuable stuff and valuable ideas in the world will be produced by machines. In the optimistic scenario, the main reason that this value will be flowing <i>to</i> humans, rather than merely <i>amongst</i> humans, will be because they own some of the&nbsp;machines.)</p><p>Historically humans have not been displaced by automation. I think this provides some evidence that in the near term automation will not displace humans, but in the long run it looks inevitable, since eventually machines really will be better at <i>everything</i>. Simple theories do suggest a regime where humans and automation are complementary, followed by a regime in which they are substitutes (as horses were once complementary with carriages, but were eventually completely replaced by automation). So at some point I think we should expect a more substantive transition. The most likely path today seems to be a fall in wages for many classes of workers while driving up wages for those who are still complementary with automation (a group that will shrink until it is eventually empty). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU\">“Humans need not apply”</a> has been making the rounds recently, and despite many quibbles I think it does a good job of making the&nbsp;point.</p><p>I don’t have too much to say on this point. I should emphasize that this isn’t a prediction about what will happen soon, just about what will have happened by the time that AI can actually do everything humans can do. I’m not aware of many serious objections to this (less interesting)&nbsp;claim.</p><h2><strong>Human values won’t be the only things shaping the&nbsp;future</strong></h2><p>I’d like to explicitly flag this section as more speculative. I think AI opens up a new possibility, and that this is of particular interest for those concerned with the long-term trajectory of society. But unlike the other sections, this one rests on pretty speculative&nbsp;abstractions.</p><p>Many processes influence what the world will look like in 50 years. Most of those processes are not goal-directed, and push things in a somewhat random direction; an asteroid might hit earth and kill us all, the tectonic plates will shift, we’ll have more bottles in landfills because we’ll keep throwing bottles away, we’ll send some more radiation into space. One force stands out amongst all of these by systematically pushing in a particular direction: humans have desires for what the future looks like (amongst other desires), and they (sometimes) take actions to achieve desired outcomes. People want themselves and their children to be prosperous, and so they do whatever they think will achieve that. If people want a particular building to keep standing, they do whatever they think will keep it standing. As human capacities increase, these goal-oriented actions have tended to become more important compared to other processes, and I expect this trend to&nbsp;continue.</p><p>There are very few goal-directed forces shaping the future aside from human preferences. I think this is a great cause for optimism: if humans survive for the long run, I expect the world to look basically how we want it to look. As a human, I’m happy about that. I don’t mean “human preferences” in a narrow way; I think humans have a preference for a rich and diverse future, that we care about other life that exists or could have existed, and so on. But it’s easy to imagine processes pushing the world in directions that we don’t like, like the self-replicator that just wants to fill the universe with copies of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>We can see the feeble beginnings of competing forces in various human organizations. We can imagine an organization which pursues its goals for the future even if there are no humans who share those goals. We can imagine such an organization eventually shaping what other organizations and people exist, campaigning to change the law, developing new technologies, etc., to make a world better suited to achieving its goals. At the moment this process is relatively well contained. It would be surprising (though not unthinkable) to find ourselves in a future where 30% of resources were controlled by PepsiCo, fulfilling a corporate mission which was completely uninteresting to humans. Instead PepsiCo remains at the mercy of human interests, by design and by necessity of its structure. After all, PepsiCo is just a bunch of humans working together, legally bound to behave in the interest of some other&nbsp;humans.</p><p>As automation improves the situation may change. Enterprises might be autonomously managed, pursuing values which are instrumentally useful to society but which we find intrinsically worthless (e.g. PepsiCo can create value for society even if its goal is merely maximizing its own profits). Perhaps society would ensure that PepsiCo’s values are to maximize profit only insofar as such profit-maximization is in the interest of humans. But that sounds complicated, and I wouldn’t make a confident prediction one way or the other. (I’m talking about firms because its an example we can already see around us, but I don’t mean to be down on firms or to suggest that automation will be most important in the context of&nbsp;firms.)</p><p>At the same time, it becomes increasingly difficult for humans to directly control what happens in a world where nearly all productive work, including management, investment, and the design of new machines, is being done by machines. We can imagine a scenario in which humans continue to make all goal-oriented decisions about the management of PepsiCo but are assisted by an increasingly elaborate network of prosthetics and assistants. But I think human management becomes increasingly implausible as the size of the world grows (imagine a minority of 7 billion humans trying to manage the equivalent of 7 trillion knowledge workers; then imagine 70 trillion), and as machines’ abilities to plan and decide outstrip humans’ by a widening margin. In this world, the AIs that are left to do their own thing outnumber and outperform those which remain under close management of&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Moreover, I think most people don’t much care about whether resources are held by agents who share their long-term values, or machines with relatively alien values, and won’t do very much to prevent the emergence of autonomous interests with alien values. On top of that, I think that machine intelligences can make a plausible case that they deserve equal moral standing, that machines will be able to argue persuasively along these lines, and that an increasingly cosmopolitan society will be hesitant about taking drastic anti-machine measures (whether to prevent machines from having “anti-social” values, or reclaiming resources or denying rights to machines with such&nbsp;values).</p><p>Again, it would be possible to imagine a regulatory response to avoid this outcome. In this case the welfare losses of regulation would be much smaller than in either of the last two, and on a certain moral view the costs of no regulation might be much larger. So in addition to resting on more speculative abstractions, I think that this consequence is the one most likely to be subverted by coordination. It’s also the one that I feel most strongly about. I look forward to a world where no humans have to work, and I’m excited to see a radical speedup in technological progress. But I would be sad to see a future where our descendants were maximizing some uninteresting values we happened to give them because they were easily specified and instrumentally useful at the&nbsp;time.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"9GQf4Ec6ckqvnPBSw":2,"u3Xg8MjDe2e6BvKtv":2,"ZiKs8Bbvse4DMcEPr":2},"voteCount":8,"baseScore":33,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000258,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:27:06.969Z","name":"AI alignment","slug":"ai-alignment","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>AI alignment</strong> tag is used for posts that discuss aligning AI systems with human interests, and for meta-discussion about whether this goal is worthwhile, achievable, etc.</p><h2 id=\"Evaluation\">Evaluation</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/80-000-hours\">80,000 Hours</a> rates AI alignment a \"highest priority area\": a problem at the top of their ranking of global issues assessed by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/itn-framework-1\">importance, tractability and neglectedness</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreforjzl17i9vi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnorjzl17i9vi\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Christiano, Paul (2020) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/63stBTw3WAW6k45dY/paul-christiano-current-work-in-ai-alignment\">Current work in AI alignment</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>, April 3.</p><p>Shah, Rohin (2020) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nqTdRNngCGDD54owu/rohin-shah-what-s-been-happening-in-ai-alignment\">What’s been happening in AI alignment?</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>, July 29.</p><h2 id=\"External_links\">External links</h2><p><a href=\"https://alignmentforum.org/\">AI Alignment Forum</a>.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/ai-forecasting\">AI forecasting</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/alignment-tax\">alignment tax</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/center-for-human-compatible-artificial-intelligence\">Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/governance-of-artificial-intelligence\">governance of artificial intelligence</a> | <a href=\"/tag/machine-intelligence-research-institute\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/rationality-community\">rationality community</a></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnorjzl17i9vi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreforjzl17i9vi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>80,000 Hours (2021) <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">Our current list of the most important world problems</a>, <i>80,000 Hours</i>.</p></div></li></ol>","postCount":363,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"9GQf4Ec6ckqvnPBSw"},{"createdAt":"2020-07-21T03:16:46.017Z","name":"Governance of artificial intelligence","slug":"governance-of-artificial-intelligence","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>governance of artificial intelligence</strong> (or <strong>AI governance</strong>) is the study of norms, policies, and institutions that can help humanity navigate the transition to a world with advanced <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/artificial-intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>.

As Holden writes, &quot;The most efficient markets can be consistently beaten only by the most talented/dedicated players, while the least efficient [markets] can be beaten with fairly little in the way of talent and dedication.&quot;</p><p>Moreover, market efficiency is multi-dimensional. Any particular market may be efficient in some ways, and in some domains, while highly inefficient in other ways and other domains.</p><p></p><h2>Charity as an inefficient market</h2><p></p><p>Financial markets are relatively efficient. It&apos;s rare for players to consistently beat the market by a large margin. You can beat the average by investing in a <a href=\"https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/mutualfundinvesting/indexfunds\">low-fee index fund</a>, but not by a lot, and it&apos;s hard to beat hedge funds.</p><p>Philanthropic markets appear to be less efficient than financial markets in many ways. In charity, one can consistently beat the market by a wide margin simply by giving to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell&apos;s recommended charities</a>, which achieve far greater returns (in social value) per marginal dollar than the average charity does. However, Holden <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">points out</a> that it has been surprisingly difficult for GiveWell to find ways to beat <em>well-run large foundations</em> like the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Gates Foundation</a>&apos;s work in global health.</p><p></p><h2>Why should we expect charity to be less efficient than financial markets?</h2><p></p><p>For one thing, most people giving to charity don&apos;t even seem to <em>care</em> what returns (in social value) they&apos;re getting with their investments. That&apos;s why, when proto-GiveWell initially contacted a bunch of charities to ask for evidence of positive impact, some of those charities reported that nobody who gave them money had ever <em>asked</em> that question before. And when charities sent proto-GiveWell their internal reports about effectiveness, they were so inadequate that they &quot;led [proto-GiveWell] to understand that the charities <em>themselves</em> did not know whether they were helping or hurting a given situation&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/With-Charity-All-Charities-Failing/dp/038553471X/\">Stern 2012</a>).</p><p>For another thing, &quot;market incentives of the nonprofit world push charities toward happy anecdote and inspiring narrative rather than toward careful planning, research, and evidence-based investments&quot; (details <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/With-Charity-All-Charities-Failing/dp/038553471X/\">here</a>).</p><p>Also, as Brian Tomasik <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/comment-page-1/#comment-542070\">notes</a>, &quot;Efficiency in the realm of charity is inherently less plausible than in financial markets because in charity there&#x2019;s not a common unit of what &apos;good&apos; means... Indeed, one man&#x2019;s good may be another man&#x2019;s bad (e.g., abortion, gun control, extinction risks).&quot; But even when we focus on relatively common units of &apos;good&apos; (e.g. human welfare, QALYs, or DALYs), charity is still relatively inefficient: we can easily purchase more QALYs per dollar via <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">AMF</a> than via, say, the popular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-A-Wish_Foundation\">Make-a-Wish Foundation</a>.\n</p><h2>What is &quot;broad market efficiency&quot;, then?</h2>\nIf Holden agrees that philanthropic markets are relatively inefficient in the sense that it&apos;s easy to consistently and substantially beat average market returns by giving to GiveWell&apos;s recommended charities, then what does he mean by &quot;broad market efficiency&quot;? Holden introduces &quot;broad market efficiency&quot; as a term for the <em>spectrum</em> of market efficiency, but remains uncertain as to where charity falls on that spectrum of market efficiency.<p></p><p>Brian Tomasik <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/comment-page-1/#comment-542070\">worried</a> that the term &quot;broad market efficiency&quot; would confuse some readers into thinking Holden was claiming that philanthropic markets are relatively efficient and thus that &quot;it doesn&#x2019;t really matter where you donate.&quot; Holden <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/comment-page-1/#comment-542975\">said</a> he wasn&apos;t worried about this, saying, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think &apos;broad market efficiency&apos; is a common phrase or one with a clear meaning.&quot; But I think the phrase <em>is</em> confusing, that many readers interpret it as meaning &quot;market efficiency,&quot; and indeed that people in economics and finance sometimes use it that way: search for the phrase &quot;broad market efficiency&quot; <a href=\"%5Bhttps://www2.blackrock.com/webcore/litService/search/getDocument.seam?venue=PUB_INS&amp;source=CONTENT&amp;ServiceName=PublicServiceView&amp;ContentID=1111183580%5D(http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Singal-Beyond-the-Random-Walk-Preface.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Blackrock-Securities-Lending-unlocking-the-full-potential-of-investment-porfolios.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ooi-et-al-Extrapolation-theory-and-hte-pricing-of-REIT-stocks.pdf\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.greaterfool.ca/2011/04/10/depraved/#comment-94887\">here</a>.</p><p></p><h2>The research ahead</h2><p></p><p>So how efficient <em>is</em> the charitable market, and in which ways? My own guess is that it&apos;s far less efficient than financial markets, but GiveWell&apos;s research has <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">provided</a> valuable and surprising (to me) information on this topic, and I look forward to future discoveries.</p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ie7/how_efficient_is_the_charitable_market/\">LessWrong</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":1,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.00000438669973136907,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"urayBifZX4cj74okH","postedAt":"2013-08-29T04:00:52.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Replaceability in altruism","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":null,"pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/urayBifZX4cj74okH/replaceability-in-altruism","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking a lot lately about GiveWell&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/\">difficulties</a> finding opportunities for funding. Shockingly enough, despite lots of inefficiencies in the market for other people&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QALY\">QALYs</a>, it turns out that if you get a group of impressive people to run a transparent charity with an evidence-based intervention, you will probably get funding. (Surprise!) This has led me to be <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/downgrading-confidence-earning-give\">unsure</a> about the effectiveness of having effective altruists donate to charities like GiveWell&#x2019;s recommended ones.</p><p>In other words, <strong>replaceability applies to altruistic decisions just as much as to career choice.</strong> While it&#x2019;s hard to get people fully into the mindset of effective altruism, there are some things, like funding proven charities where you can easily persuade outsiders to help. So, to maximize the leverage we get as altruists, we should focus on areas where replaceability applies the least. What are such comparative advantages for us?</p><p></p><h2>Starting new things</h2><p></p><p>Starting a thing is scary. It takes a lot more additional agency and dedication than just donating a chunk of income. Fortunately, the EA community seems to select (somewhat) for agenty dedicated people, probably by dint of filtering for people who think &#x201C;I should try really hard to help people&#x201D; <em>and then start trying really hard</em>. For instance, people <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/03/why-it-should-be-easy-to-dominate-givewells-recommendations.html\">proposed</a> that a fundraising organization would be a highly cost-effective charity; one year after the linked article was published, <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/\">it exists</a>.<sup><a href=\"#fn:dothings\">1</a></sup></p><p>Starting a thing doesn&#x2019;t have to be full-time, of course. There are probably many really helpful projects, both small and large, where actually doing the project would be more effective than earning money and paying someone else to do it. For instance, I and some other folks are exploring the possibility of developing web apps for the EA community. It seems valuable to have these apps built and maintained by people who care about EA, not just people who did it for hire&#x2014;valuable enough that I think we should do it ourselves.</p><p></p><h2>Working for EA organizations</h2><p></p><p>All the EA organizations that I&#x2019;ve talked to have mentioned difficulty in finding people. This is despite the fact that I know many people in the movement who seem like they would be quite good candidates. I&#x2019;m wondering if this is because the earning-to-give meme has propagated so strongly that <em>everyone</em> decides they would rather earn money and fund someone else working there, and then they don&#x2019;t apply, leading to a shortage of qualified applicants. At any rate, few enough people have the required skills and attitudes to work at e.g. GiveWell, Giving What We Can or 80,000 Hours that it seems pretty non-replaceable.</p><p></p><h2>Building community/ideology</h2><p></p><p>So far, we&#x2019;ve done a great job of growing without compromising on intellectual standards. The Facebook group, for instance, is about six times the size it was when I joined, but the discussion is still lively and interesting. But we&#x2019;ll need to devote lots of resources to making sure this continues through the next few orders of magnitude, and that&#x2019;s not something we can easily outsource. There&#x2019;s some progress being made right now, on Wikipedia editing and discussion media, but I think we can do much more to ensure that as the community grows we maintain its high quality of thought.</p><p></p><h2>Being risk-neutral in donations</h2><p></p><p>Donors driven by signalling, prestige, or warm fuzzies tend to be unhappy when charities they donate to don&#x2019;t get results. But effective altruists know that individually, we should just be maximizing expected outcome, and if that requires a high-risk strategy, so be it. In other words, even if we&#x2019;re personally risk-averse <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2010-12-07\">we should be altruistically risk neutral</a>. This (hopefully) means that we can operate something like philanthropic venture capitalists&#x2014;fund pie-in-the-sky ventures that are too risky for most donors, and thus collect a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_premium\">risk premium</a> (paid in QALYs, not dollars, but it&#x2019;s the same idea).</p><p></p><h2>Funding meta things</h2><p></p><p>It&#x2019;s relatively easy for object-level effective interventions to get funds, because they can appeal to those even without the effective-altruist mindset. For &#x201C;meta&#x201D; organizations like <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, though, that&#x2019;s not the case, so fundraising is harder for them. So donations from effective altruists are much less replaceable.</p><p>Well, these are the things I can think of off the top of my head. I&#x2019;m guessing that because of replaceability concerns, at least one of these would be more effective than donating to GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities for most people.

However, imagine that, instead of volunteering ourselves, we paid a janitor minimum wage to do the cleaning instead.

The grizzled old prospector at the general store shakes his head sadly: you can't afford everything you need; you'll just have to purchase the bare essentials and hope you get lucky. But what is essential? Should you buy the warmest parka, if it means you can't afford a sleeping bag? Should you bring an extra week's food, just in case, even if it means going without a rifle? Or can you buy the rifle, leave the food, and hunt for your dinner?</p>\n<p>And how about the field guide to Arctic flowers? You like flowers, and you'd hate to feel like you're failing to appreciate the harsh yet delicate environment around you. And a digital camera, of course - if you make it back alive, you'll have to put the Arctic expedition pics up on Facebook. And a hand-crafted scarf with authentic Inuit tribal patterns woven from organic fibres! Wicked!</p>\n<p>...but of course buying any of those items would be insane. The problem is what economists call opportunity costs: buying one thing costs money that could be used to buy others. A hand-crafted designer scarf might have some value in the Arctic, but it would cost so much it would prevent you from buying much more important things. And when your life is on the line, things like impressing your friends and buying organic pale in comparison. You have one goal - staying alive - and your only problem is how to distribute your resources to keep your chances as high as possible. These sorts of economics concepts are natural enough when faced with a journey through the freezing tundra.</p>\n<p>But they are decidedly not natural when facing a decision about charitable giving. Most donors say they want to \"help people\". If that's true, they should try to distribute their resources to help people as much as possible. Most people don't. In the <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/savebluerigi/Introduction.html\">\"Buy A Brushstroke\"</a> campaign, eleven thousand British donors gave a total of 550,000 pounds to keep the famous painting \"Blue Rigi\" in a UK museum. If they had given that 550,000 pounds to buy better sanitation systems in African villages instead, the latest statistics suggest it would have saved the lives of about one thousand two hundred people from disease. Each individual $50 donation could have given a year of normal life back to a Third Worlder afflicted with a disabling condition like blindness or limb deformity..</p>\n<p>Most of those 11,000 donors genuinely wanted to help people by preserving access to the original canvas of a beautiful painting. And most of those 11,000 donors, if you asked, would say that a thousand people's lives are more important than a beautiful painting, original or no. But these people didn't have the proper mental habits to realize that was the choice before them, and so a beautiful painting remains in a British museum and somewhere in the Third World a thousand people are dead.</p>\n<p>If you are to \"love your neighbor as yourself\", then you should be as careful in maximizing the benefit to others when donating to charity as you would be in maximizing the benefit to yourself when choosing purchases for a polar trek. And if you wouldn't buy a pretty picture to hang on your sled in preference to a parka, you should consider not helping save a famous painting in preference to helping save a thousand lives.</p>\n<p>Not all charitable choices are as simple as that one, but many charitable choices do have right answers. GiveWell.org, a site which collects and interprets data on the effectiveness of charities, predicts that antimalarial drugs save one child from malaria per $5,000 worth of medicine, but insecticide-treated bed nets save one child from malaria per $500 worth of netting. If you want to save children, donating bed nets instead of antimalarial drugs is the objectively right answer, the same way buying a $500 TV instead of an identical TV that costs $5,000 is the right answer. And since saving a child from diarrheal disease costs $5,000, donating to an organization fighting malaria instead of an organization fighting diarrhea is the right answer, unless you are donating based on some criteria other than whether you're helping children or not.</p>\n<p>Say all of the best Arctic explorers agree that the three most important things for surviving in the Arctic are good boots, a good coat, and good food. Perhaps they have run highly unethical studies in which they release thousands of people into the Arctic with different combination of gear, and consistently find that only the ones with good boots, coats, and food survive. Then there is only one best answer to the question \"What gear do I buy if I want to survive\" - good boots, good food, and a good coat. Your preferences are irrelevant; you may choose to go with alternate gear, but only if you don't mind dying.</p>\n<p>And likewise, there is only one best charity: the one that helps the most people the greatest amount per dollar. This is vague, and it is up to you to decide whether a charity that raises forty children's marks by one letter grade for $100 helps people more or less than one that prevents one fatal case of tuberculosis per $100 or one that saves twenty acres of rainforest per $100. But you cannot abdicate the decision, or you risk ending up like the 11,000 people who accidentally decided that a pretty picture was worth more than a thousand people's lives.</p>\n<p>Deciding which charity is the best is hard. It may be straightforward to say that one form of antimalarial therapy is more effective than another. But how do both compare to financing medical research that might or might not develop a \"magic bullet\" cure for malaria? Or financing development of a new kind of supercomputer that might speed up all medical research? There is no easy answer, but the question has to be asked.</p>\n<p>What about just comparing charities on overhead costs, the one easy-to-find statistic that's universally applicable across all organizations? This solution is simple, elegant, and wrong. High overhead costs are only one possible failure mode for a charity. Consider again the Arctic explorer, trying to decide between a $200 parka and a $200 digital camera. Perhaps a parka only cost $100 to make and the manufacturer takes $100 profit, but the camera cost $200 to make and the manufacturer is selling it at cost. This speaks in favor of the moral qualities of the camera manufacturer, but given the choice the explorer should still buy the parka. The camera does something useless very efficiently, the parka does something vital inefficiently. A parka sold at cost would be best, but in its absence the explorer shouldn't hesitate to choose the the parka over the camera. The same applies to charity. An antimalarial net charity that saves one life per $500 with 50% overhead is better than an antidiarrheal drug charity that saves one life per $5000 with 0% overhead: $10,000 donated to the high-overhead charity will save ten lives; $10,000 to the lower-overhead will only save two. Here the right answer is to donate to the antimalarial charity while encouraging it to find ways to lower its overhead. In any case, <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/\">examining the financial practices of a charity</a> is helpful but not enough to answer the \"which is the best charity?\" question.</p>\n<p>Just as there is only one best charity, there is only one best way to donate to that charity. Whether you <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/65/money_the_unit_of_caring/\">volunteer versus donate money</a> versus raise awareness is your own choice, but that choice has consequences. If a high-powered lawyer who makes $1,000 an hour chooses to take an hour off to help clean up litter on the beach, he's wasted the opportunity to work overtime that day, make $1,000, donate to a charity that will hire a hundred poor people for $10/hour to clean up litter, and end up with a hundred times more litter removed. If he went to the beach because he wanted the sunlight and the fresh air and the warm feeling of personally contributing to something, that's fine. If he actually wanted to help people by beautifying the beach, he's chosen an objectively wrong way to go about it. And if he wanted to help people, period, he's chosen a very wrong way to go about it, since that $1,000 could save two people from malaria. Unless the litter he removed is really worth more than two people's lives to him, he's erring even according to his own value system.</p>\n<p>...and the same is true if his philanthropy leads him to work full-time at a nonprofit instead of going to law school to become a lawyer who makes $1,000 / hour in the first place. Unless it's one HELL of a nonprofit.</p>\n<p>The Roman historian Sallust said of Cato \"He preferred to be good, rather than to seem so\". The lawyer who quits a high-powered law firm to work at a nonprofit organization certainly seems like a good person. But if we define \"good\" as helping people, then the lawyer who stays at his law firm but donates the profit to charity is taking Cato's path of maximizing how much good he does, rather than how good he looks.</p>\n<p>And this dichotomy between being and seeming good applies not only to looking good to others, but to ourselves. When we donate to charity, one incentive is the <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_separately/\">warm glow of a job well done</a>. A lawyer who spends his day picking up litter will feel a sense of personal connection to his sacrifice and relive the memory of how nice he is every time he and his friends return to that beach. A lawyer who works overtime and donates the money online to starving orphans in Romania may never get that same warm glow. But concern with a warm glow is, at root, concern about seeming good rather than being good - albeit seeming good to yourself rather than to others. There's nothing wrong with donating to charity as a form of entertainment if it's what you want - giving money to the Art Fund may well be a quicker way to give yourself a warm feeling than seeing a romantic comedy at the cinema - but charity given by people who genuinely want to be good and not just to feel that way requires more forethought.</p>\n<p>It is important to be rational about charity for the same reason it is important to be rational about Arctic exploration: it requires the same awareness of opportunity costs and the same hard-headed commitment to investigating efficient use of resources, and it may well be a matter of life and death. Consider going to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org\">www.GiveWell.org</a> and making use of the excellent resources on effective charity they have available.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"tmQ7kd3bFTnSQveDv":2,"L6NqHZkLc4xZ7YtDr":1,"ns9DfYvtox2pxEFxD":1},"voteCount":23,"baseScore":34,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000233,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T11:29:32.672Z","name":"Philosophy of effective altruism","slug":"philosophy-of-effective-altruism","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>Philosophy of effective altruism</strong> tag covers posts about the philosophical ideas behind EA, especially when they don't discuss particular causes or research methods.</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>MacAskill, William &amp; Darius Meissner (2020) <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/acting-on-utilitarianism#effective-altruism\">Effective altruism</a>, in 'Acting on utilitarianism', <i>Utilitarianism</i>.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/philosophy\">philosophy</a></p>","postCount":87,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"tmQ7kd3bFTnSQveDv"},{"createdAt":"2021-01-19T14:54:58.066Z","name":"Effective giving","slug":"effective-giving-1","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Effective giving</strong> is the branch of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism\">effective altruism</a> focused on charitable donations.</p><p>The main purpose of effective giving is to support a charity that can achieve an especially large amount of good with that support.

Why? Well, because most people are overconfident about most things.</p><p>If I&#x2019;m overconfident about my ability to guess the total egg production of the US, that&#x2019;s not that problematic. But if I&#x2019;m wrong about the best ways of doing good, that would be a disaster.</p><p>So I take very seriously the extent of empirical and moral disagreement, and am attracted to causes that are valuable on a wide variety of moral theories - such as building a community of people who place high value on both altruism and on having the correct moral and empirical beliefs.</p><p>But, even then, I worry that I&#x2019;m making some fundamental mistake - that there&#x2019;s some component of my thinking that&#x2019;s so deeply wired that I struggle to even acknowledge it as a component. This is most worrying when I get objections to EA activities that are common but that I don&#x2019;t even understand. Let me explain.</p><p>If someone complains that <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/what-earning-give-0\">earning to give</a> is &#x2018;double counting&#x2019;, because it means that both the person earning to give and the charity worker get &#x2018;credit&#x2019; for saving lives, then I understand the objection, recognise the mistake, and can refer the objector to <a href=\"http://www.stafforini.com/txt/Parfit - Five mistakes in moral mathematics.pdf\">Five Mistakes in Moral Mathematics</a> in Derek Parfit&#x2019;s <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_and_Persons\">Reasons and Persons</a></em>.</p><p>But if someone complains that earning to give is wrong because it is supporting an unjust system, or because the very idea of trying to work out how much good you can do is mistaken, then I feel much less confident that I&#x2019;ve accurately diagnosed their objection. I try to parse it into terms that I can understand and sympathise with, for example: &#x201C;Are you saying that there&#x2019;s a moral prohibition against being complicit in injustice, which can&#x2019;t be violated even in pursuit of a greater good?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Are you saying that weighing expected costs and expected benefits is just so difficult that we&#x2019;re almost certain to be misled by doing so, and it&#x2019;s better to go with gut intuitive judgments?&#x201D;</p><p>But, with my self-skeptical hat on, I get an uneasy sense that none of my translations are quite right - especially when they don&#x2019;t convince the other person.</p><p>So far, there hasn&#x2019;t been much in-depth discussion of effective altruism from people who have these sorts of objections, and I think a decent proportion of my worry could be resolved if I did have more discussion from such people. So if any reader has a friend or colleague who understands effective altruism well, is well-informed about the relevant issues, but thinks that the whole idea is badly mistaken, I&#x2019;d welcome them to write a post or series on this blog explaining why. (I&#x2019;d welcome the same for people who majorly disagree with not just the specifics but the very project or spirit of Bayesian epistemology).</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"95jaA45tFMB7ENWe2":2,"8sbHXePJ4L5o8G5aM":2},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":3,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000091,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T08:59:30.749Z","name":"Rationality","slug":"rationality","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>Use the <strong>Rationality</strong> tag for posts about trying to think more clearly in general (not just about a particular cause, intervention, etc.)</p>\n<p>This tag can cover personal rationality (e.g. making better decisions or predictions) as well as group or movement-level rationality (e.g. how the EA movement can do a better job of estimating the cost-effectiveness of an intervention).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/cognitive-bias\">cognitive bias</a></p>\n","postCount":144,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"95jaA45tFMB7ENWe2"},{"createdAt":"2020-08-12T08:26:10.599Z","name":"Moral uncertainty","slug":"moral-uncertainty","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Moral uncertainty</strong> is uncertainty about how to act given lack of certainty in any one moral theory, as well as the study of how we ought to act given this uncertainty.</p><p>We are sometimes uncertain about empirical facts, such as whether it will rain tomorrow.

This does tend to involve some amount of sacrifice, but if I could have a larger impact with less sacrifice that would be a good thing.  In fact I <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/balancing-costs-to-ourselves-with-benefits-to-others\">choose my altruistic activities</a> to do as much as possible with as little sacrifice as possible.  So reactions like this confuse me:\n\n</p><blockquote>\nFor me, altruism should involve more than sparing the poor a few crumbs from our table.  It should be about changing our behaviour and trying to be nicer to the people we find most irritating. Peter Singer&apos;s Effective Altruism doesn&apos;t address this aspect of good living at all. His movement is just about doing stuff with money. It&apos;s a cult for wealthy middle-class Westerners who don&apos;t want to change their behaviour but feel a bit guilty about the comfort they live in. The Effective Altruism movement allows its followers to continue their privileged existences&#x2014;they buy themselves absolution by signing a direct debit docket to one of the EA-authorised charities. True altruism involves self-sacrifice; Singer&apos;s altruism involves salary sacrifice and nothing more. (<a href=\"http://overland.org.au/2013/09/affective-altruism/\">source</a>)\n</blockquote>\n\nIf I were talking to this writer in person I would suggest we <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/\">taboo</a> the word &quot;altruism&quot; and talk at a lower level.  They would probably expand &quot;altruism&quot; to something like &quot;making substantial sacrifices for the benefit of others&quot; while I would expand it to just &quot;working to benefit others&quot;.  We could go on from there to discuss why they think &quot;making substantial sacrifices&quot; is important in and of itself, to the point of not valuing an approach that &quot;involves salary sacrifice and nothing more.&quot;  Maybe we would reach an agreement, maybe we wouldn&apos;t, but we&apos;d get closer to understanding what we disagreed about.\n<p>\n\nAs participants in a broader discourse around &quot;altruism&quot;, however, we should push for an understanding of the term that isn&apos;t about giving things up.

It&#x2019;s a simple idea: create an organisation that does nothing except fundraise for GiveWell&#x2019;s top recommendations. It <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising\">seems relatively easy</a> to raise more than $1 for every $1 invested in fundraising, so it seems relatively easy to act as a multiplier on donations to other charities, and thus create an organisation with a cost-effectiveness ratio that&#x2019;s higher than the charities themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The idea has merit from other angles too, for instance, <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising\">there&#x2019;s reason to expect</a> that charities don&#x2019;t fundraise as much as would be optimal, and it&#x2019;s a valuable service to them to take fundraising off their books. It&#x2019;s also promising because the success of fundraising is relatively easy to quantify compared to many other meta-charity activities (like doing research or advocacy). This means that you can learn quickly whether you&#x2019;re succeeding, which means you can improve quickly.</p>\n\n<p>We were thrilled, therefore, to find that two 80k members, Joey and Xio, are planning to start an organisation that does exactly this. It&#x2019;s called <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/\">Effective Fundraising</a>. Their plan is to start by writing grants for <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF) and <a href=\"http://www.thehumaneleague.com/\">The Humane League</a> for six months. If it goes well, they could hire more people. Longer term, they could expand into others kinds of fundraising. They chose grant writing because (i) surveys of average fundraising ratios found that grant writing earns an average return of around $8 for every $1 invested, which is higher than most other forms of fundraising (ii) the money can be raised within 6-18 months, unlike &#x2018;chugging&#x2019; (asking for donations on the street) or door-to-door which takes several years to pay off.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio sought out a huge amount of advice on their strategy. They&#x2019;re some of the most altruistic people we know, and recently put college on hold in Canada in order to work on effective altruist start-ups. One of the sources they consulted was 80,000 Hours, and we were very happy to help. Rob Wiblin and I spent several hours thinking about their strategy and several hours discussing with Joey and Xio. (They have also sought advice from the other employees of 80,000 Hours and our President, Will MacAskill).</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio were mainly seeking advice on how best to execute the project. In the rest of this post, we outline the main recommendations we made during the course of the discussion. Although our discussions didn&#x2019;t lead to an immediate change in their plans, we hope this contributes to the discussion that Joey and Xio have been leading on how best to fundraise for top GiveWell recommendations, and inspires others to consider similar ways to make a difference. In summary:</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>We think:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Working on Effective Fundraising looks like a very strong option for building career capital.</li>\n\n<li>They could consider running more experiments before committing to grant-writing for 6 months.</li>\n\n<li>They may be having less impact than they could because they may not be supporting the most high priority causes.</li>\n\n<li>They should strongly consider hiring someone else to work for Effective Fundraising as a grant writer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>(1) We agree that working on Effective Fundraising looks like a very strong option for building career capital</h3>\n\n<p>By founding their own organisation, we expect them to learn a variety of very useful entrepreneurial skills very rapidly. They should also improve their ability to fundraise, which is a highly useful skill for someone looking to work in the non-profit sector, but also involves sales skills that are useful almost everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>This seems better than the skill development they could have working at another effective altruist organisation, where they would probably be given less responsibility, particularly if they make sure they prioritise learning while running Effective Fundraising (which they are).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Effective Fundraising offers more long-term upside. If it works, it could grow into large, new organisation within effective altruism.</p>\n\n<h3>(2) They could consider running more experiments before committing to grant-writing for 6 months.</h3>\n\n<p>We both agree that it&#x2019;s very important to test this project before scaling it up. We place higher weight on this factor than Joey and Xio, because because we think:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There&#x2019;s a large amount of uncertainty about much money they might expect to raise with different methods</li>\n\n<li>It seems relatively easy to learn more about how much money they might expect to raise by trying out different methods for a couple of months each.</li>\n\n<li>This information would be very valuable, because it could significantly improve how they spend a year of effort, and the information would be valuable to other effective altruists considering the same thing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Moreover, we think testing grant writing has lower value of information than testing other fundraising, because the feedback is weak.</p>\n\n<p>First, grant writing often has low success ratios. If your base rate of success is only 5%, then you will need to write a lot of grants to measure your ratio. We did a quick analysis, assuming that you have a 50% chance of being as good as professional grant writers (who we modelled as having three levels of ability, based on <a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/\">Institute of Fundraising</a> (IoF) data and assuming a base rate of success of 5%), and a 50% chance of not being able to raise money via grant-writing. We then asked: how many attempts would you have to make before you can be confident that grant writing is better than a guaranteed 3 times pay-off? Assuming a binomial distribution on successes, and performing a bayesian update, we found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It would take 47 failures in a row to become 90% confident that grant writing is worse</li>\n\n<li>It would take 13 failures in a row for the expected value of grant writing to drop below a guaranteed 3 times return.</li>\n\n<li>On the other hand, 2-3 successes out of the first 5 or so would push grant writing strongly ahead. (You can see the spreadsheet <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuJhoc5Aa_5WdGF2TEpNSVJacFJZeTQ1TkktMGhKSUE#gid=7\">here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Second, you have to wait 6-12 months to hear the results.</p>\n\n<p>Note that both of these concerns can be mitigated to some extent by starting with easy grants that have close deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio, however, think that the reasons behind grant writing are sufficiently strong that they should start immediately and do it for six months as a test. In particular they respond:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The uncertainty is less than made out, because there is some data provided by the IoF on the returns of different methods. In particular, the average grant-writer makes 8 times their salary, and the bottom 15% make 5 times their salary. So, even if they perform at the bottom of grant writers, it will be better to do grant-writing than most other forms of fundraising.</li>\n\n<li>It&#x2019;s harder to experiment than it looks. &#x201C;You need licenses to do door-to-door fundraising and street fundraising, and it takes years for you to determine if the recurring donations have a good ratio. Legacies take several years, and sometimes decades to see returns. Both corporate and high net worth donors take considerable time to learn the field and become good at. In 6 months it might be possible to sufficiently test one of these. We think the data, while not as strong as we would like, is enough to show that grant writing is promising, and that it is worth a six to twelve month test.&#x201D;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We note some countervailing considerations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#x2019;s unclear how good the Institute of Fundraising data is, because they don&#x2019;t publish their methods. For instance, they may not correct for survivorship bias - maybe fundraisers who don&#x2019;t succeed don&#x2019;t survive till the end of the year, so don&#x2019;t appear in the data as collected. We&#x2019;d also expect the figures to be systematically overstated, because charities have an incentive to keep fundraising costs low, so will try to put fundraising costs under different budget lines (moreover, this seems easier to do with grant writing or high net-worth fundraising than with chugging, because much grant writing is done by managers who have other responsibilities).</li>\n\n<li>The IoF data seems to be <em>the returns earned by people who currently work as grant-writers.</em> Grant-writers who earn less than 5 times their salary lose their jobs very quickly, so the data <em>obviously</em> shows that the ratios are higher than 5 times. This information doesn&#x2019;t tell us much about how much money Joey and Xio might expect to earn by grant-writing.</li>\n\n<li>There are reasons to expect Joey and Xio will earn less. The average grant-writer is paid over &#xA3;30,000 per year, which is a professional salary and probably equivalent to something like earning &#xA3;60,000 in the corporate sector. This suggests that it&#x2019;s a competitive field. On the other hand, this might be balanced out by the fact that (i) Against Malaria Foundation should be relatively easy to fundraise for (ii) Joey and Xio will prioritise learning and feedback so that they improve at grant writing as quickly as possible.</li>\n\n<li>Even if the licenses for other types of fundraising take several days of full-time work to get, it will still be worth it. Moreover, there seem to be ways to do tests without a license, for instance, you don&#x2019;t collect payment details and instead just collect pledges for donations and email addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, we didn&#x2019;t reach agreement. Joey and Xio still intend to commit to grant writing, while we suspect it may be better to prioritise experimentation slightly higher.</p>\n\n<h3>(3) They may be having less impact than they could because they may not be supporting the most high priority causes.</h3>\n\n<p>We agree that supporting GiveWell recommendations is highly valuable and that the project has an attractive flexibility, since (to some extent) it will be possible to fundraise for different organisations as the evidence changes.</p>\n\n<p>We think, however, that AMF and The Humane League might not be the most promising uses of money currently available, so Joey and Xio might be able to increase expected returns by funding someone else.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio&#x2019;s response is that: They are a fundraising organization, not a charity evaluation organization. They take top recommendations from Givewell and Effective Animal Activism, two of the most recognized charity evaluators in their respective fields.</p>\n\n<p>We think that going with GiveWell&#x2019;s recommendations is a reasonable move as it&#x2019;s plausibly the best charity evaluator in the world, but we also think it&#x2019;s worth putting more effort into the decision if your aim is really to maximise expected returns.</p>\n\n<p>First, many leading experts both within and outside of effective altruism don&#x2019;t think that GiveWell&#x2019;s recommendations clearly offer the best returns. As three examples within global poverty, IPA, AidGrade and Giving What We Can are experts on evidence-based aid, and they don&#x2019;t fully agree with GiveWell although there is overlap (see <a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/provenimpact/testedandproven\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/some-friendly-concerns-with-givewell\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities\">here</a>). Disagreements are even larger if you also consider charities outside the global poverty cause.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, <em>even GiveWell</em> <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/criteria\">don&#x2019;t claim</a> that giving to AMF is generically the use of money with the highest expected return. Rather they claim that it&#x2019;s the best donation opportunity to an existing organisation that&#x2019;s proven, scalable, has room for more funding and is transparent enough that uninvolved third parties can see that it is. This leaves open the possibility that there are organisations that might be more effective to fund, work for or set up:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Unproven organisations - these could worth investing in (a) to gain information about what works or (b) because they offer high expected return despite low certainty.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that Joey and Xio have special insight into not available to GiveWell.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that Joey and Xio could support to gain valuable information about what works that wouldn&#x2019;t give GiveWell the same level of information.</li>\n\n<li>Small organisations (if room for more funding is less than several hundred thousand dollars, GiveWell won&#x2019;t normally investigate them, though <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/\">there are reasons</a> to think many of these opportunities are taken, at least outside of meta-charity style projects).</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that don&#x2019;t exist yet, but could be created if a donor expressed interest in them or a credible entrepreneur started them. GiveWell has suggested that the approach of strategically picking a cause and then being an <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/\">active donor</a> could yield better results, at least in some cases.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that GiveWell hasn&#x2019;t had time to investigate yet.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that don&#x2019;t share GiveWell&#x2019;s values (e.g. GiveWell doesn&#x2019;t currently factor animal welfare into their evaluation). Going with GiveWell recommendations means ignoring opportunities to support organisations that fall into these categories, which plausibly contain organisations that are higher impact.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Note that after this post was written, Holden replied (see the comments below), stating that GiveWell does believe that giving to AMF is currently the charitable donation opportunity with the highest expected return, in contraction to the statement above</em></p>\n\n<p>One response could be that making calls like this is difficult, so it&#x2019;s better just to stick with GiveWell. But Joey and Xio have already decided to funnel 50% of the funds raised to Effective Animal Activism&#x2019;s top recommendation, which has to date invested far less research time than GiveWell in charity evaluation. It seems inconsistent to overrule GiveWell in this case but not in the other cases.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, note that if you think that the best opportunities will typically be in these categories, then the idea of Effective Fundraising is slightly less attractive, because opportunities like these are typically difficult to fundraise for as an outsider (and seem easier to support through direct work or earning to give). We think it&#x2019;s plausible that the best opportunities in these categories will often be more attractive than proven, scalable charities, because (i) value of information is very important because we&#x2019;re highly uncertain what&#x2019;s best and opportunities like this offer more information about what works (ii) being an <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/\">active donor</a> or entrepreneur opens up the space of projects a great deal, which increases the chance finding a good one provided you have a search strategy that&#x2019;s somewhat effective (iii) <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">broad market efficiency</a> - if it has already been recognized by GiveWell, then it willl be attracting the attention of some major funders.</p>\n\n<h3>(4) They should strongly consider hiring someone else to work for Effective Fundraising as a grant writer.</h3>\n\n<p>Employing someone to write grants for AMF seems like a good use of money, but it&#x2019;s something that you don&#x2019;t need an effective altruist to do. Rather, it might be better to find a grant writer with a track record of several years and ask them to write the grants. This seems more proven and likely to result in higher returns more quickly. The fundraiser could also be paid partially on commission, reducing the downside to Effective Fundraising. This would free Joey and Xio up to work on projects that are less easy to outsource. Or, at least it could help them learn to grant write quicker. I offered to help them raise money to pay for such a person.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio raised some important additional points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It would be difficult to raise the money, especially if they don&#x2019;t want it to take funds away from effective charities.</li>\n\n<li>It&#x2019;s too risky - they prefer to trial the project themselves before scaling up.</li>\n\n<li>They&#x2019;re worried an external fundraiser might not be effectiveness oriented, which would make the organisation less flexible.</li>\n\n<li>They did not feel an external fundraiser, costing three times their combined salary, would likely raise 6 times more per hour than they would.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We agree (1) and (3) are concerns, though don&#x2019;t seem to sink the idea. Rather, it would be better to make some tests to see if (1) and (3) are true.</p>\n\n<p>(4) is not the relevant comparison. First, what matters is marginal effectiveness not average effectiveness. Even if the extra fundraiser has a lower fundraising ratio, it could still be worth hiring them because it increases the total impact. Second, the ratio of money raised to salary is not what&#x2019;s relevant from the perspective of maximising impact. Joey and Xio are happy to work on impressively low salaries, which boosts the headline cost-effectiveness of Effective Fundraising, but their opportunity cost also matters. Joey and Xio may have a higher opportunity cost than a fundraiser, because they may have the option to work on another highly effective project.</p>\n\n<p>(2) also doesn&#x2019;t seem right. If Joey and Xio try to write grants for AMF and fail, then we haven&#x2019;t learned that Effective Fundraising is a bad idea. Rather, we&#x2019;ve just learned that Joey and Xio shouldn&#x2019;t write grants. In this case, it seems like you&#x2019;d still want to find someone else to try to write grants for AMF. If Joey and Xio try to write grants for AMF and succeed, then they&#x2019;ll want to hire someone else to scale up. Either way, they&#x2019;ll want to someone else to be employed as a grant writer, and delaying that process is just slowing down moving money to AMF. Moreover, it seems that it&#x2019;s less risky to hire a professional with a track record than to do grant writing themselves.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&#x2019;t reach agreement and Joey and Xio intend to delay hiring another staff member for at least 6 months.</p>\n\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved, <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/contact-us.html\">contact Joey and Xio</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to read more about Effective Fundraising, see <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/all/lw/i2s/introducing_effective_fundraising_a_new_ea_org/\">this discussion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also check out an interview between our trustee Nick Beckstead, Joey and a donor <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/162710548?access_key=key-11juxn1x43fl0i9sm1xp&amp;allow_share=false&amp;show_recommendations=false\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#x2019;re interested in doing something similar yourself, we&#x2019;d be interested in <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/get-coaching\">doing a case study on your choice</a>.</p>\n\n<em>Crossposted from the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-the-world-s-most-effective-charity\">80,000 Hours blog</a></em></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":0,"baseScore":0,"extendedScore":null,"score":0,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"x5Q3SJXp4ACaDmR37","postedAt":"2013-09-22T04:00:15.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Want to give feedback on a draft sample chapter for a book on effective altruism?","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":null,"pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/x5Q3SJXp4ACaDmR37/want-to-give-feedback-on-a-draft-sample-chapter-for-a-book","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>For those who don&apos;t know, I&apos;m currently planning to write a book for a popular audience on effective altruism.

Someone recommended that we try to have a meta-evaluation to rank them, but on some further discussion it became apparent that that would be incredibly difficult to do.</p><p>The different organizations just don&#x2019;t have the same goals as each other. Many were &#x201C;effective&#x201D; within their own standard of epistemology, but not in those of the others. So comparing them was more about comparing general epistemologies then doing direct comparisons of the organizations themselves.</p><p>Here is my current attempt at making some sense of the &#x201C;main&#x201D; effective altruist groups, based on their disagreements on epistemology.\n</p><h2>Charity evaluators</h2>\nIt makes sense to begin with <strong><a href=\"http://givewell.org/\">Givewell</a></strong>, because they seem to be the first and most recognized group within Effective Altruism. Upon launch in 2007 they promoted the idea that charities could be evaluated on the efficiency of money put in to the amount of &#x201C;good&#x201D; outputted. This was backed up with research by the GiveWell team to identify and recognize the &#x201C;most efficient&#x201D; charities. This made a lot of sense to many smart people, but soon things became quite complicated as groups also trying to &#x201C;do the most good&#x201D; within charity evaluation emerged to somewhat compete with them.<p></p><p>GiveWell is reluctant to investigate animal welfare charities, seemingly because its founders value animals <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/12/27/animal-welfare-charities/\">substantially less than humans</a>. Other people have decided that animals are worth more in respect to humans than Givewell has indicated, and some of these have set up a &#x201C;GiveWell for Animals&#x201D;, or <strong><a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/Evaluation\">Effective Animal Altruism</a></strong>. <strong>Aidgrade</strong> was established a semi-Givewell competitor and disagrees with them about the <a href=\"http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/some-friendly-concerns-with-givewell\">proper methods to do charity evaluations</a>.\n</p><h2>Effective altruism funders</h2>\nThen come the more somewhat high-risk meta-charities that promote giving to Effective Altruist groups, like <strong>Giving What We Can</strong>, <strong>The Life You Can Save</strong>, and <strong>80,000 Hours</strong>. These groups are really interesting to me because on paper what they&#x2019;re doing seems to be working (Giving What We Can has estimated to be able to encourage the giving of around <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/donate\">$8 for every $1 donated to them</a>, for instance).<p></p><p>Yet from what I understand, GiveWell refuses to recommend any of these as top charities. My impression is that GiveWell finds it highly unlikely that any of these organizations are as effective as their recommended charities. Of course, many of these organizations exist on the assumption that they are. This area seems particularly awkward as all of these meta-charities promote GiveWell publicly, leading to <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-09-08/a-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell-part-ii\">several</a> <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell\">interviews</a>. I imagine that it&#x2019;s better off for everyone that Givewell and CEA appear as close friends, yet internally it seems like there&#x2019;s a bit of tension over this stark disagreement on the need for CEA&#x2019;s existence. This disagreement is somewhat showcased in the comments <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-a-new-organisation-that-might-be-more-effective-than-givewell-s-top-recommendation\">here</a>.</p><p>Also of note here is <strong><a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/\">Effective Fundraising</a></strong>. This group is directly writing grants for both the AMF (GiveWell&#x2019;s top choice) and the Humane League (Effective Animal Activism&#x2019;s top choice). They&#x2019;ve discussed why they split between them <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/08/how-we-select-our-charities.html\">here</a>. 80,000 Hours and CEA have interviewed them and written a blog post with a very nice name and slightly less praising contents. There&#x2019;s a bit of back and forth between them in the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-the-world-s-most-effective-charity\">comments</a>, which I referred to earlier.\n</p><h2>AI risk and far future researchers</h2>\nGoing further, when coming to the topic of AI risk, things get much more\nconfusing. Organizations like <strong><a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">FHI</a></strong> claim that AI risk and other existential risks are by far the most important causes. Holden of Givewell wrote a very long critique <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/\">here</a>, which there&#x2019;s since been quite a bit of debate about. I suspect that incredibly few people actually have a deep understanding of the efficiencies or even importance of donating to prevent AI risk, and it is quite apparent that most donating will have to go with either a gut feeling or choose based on which social group they trust more.<p></p><p>Brian Tomasik has been a very interesting and rather independent thinker within the movement, known for his series of <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/\">Utilitarian Essays</a>. Even more than animal causes, he has numbers to recommend donating for <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/humane-insecticides.html\">insect causes</a> that make it seem like a fantastic area for efficient intervention. The main argument I&#x2019;ve heard from others against insect causes is that they seem intuitively silly, not that they aren&#x2019;t actually effective.</p><p>Recently Brian has made his own research institute called <strong><a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html\">FRI</a></strong> to focus on long term suffering reduction. Sure enough it&#x2019;s his number 1 recommended charity, but more surprisingly to me is that the number 2 isn&#x2019;t another similar far-future venture like MIRI or FHI, but instead <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html\">Animal Ethics</a>. I suppose he&#x2019;s both very concerned with the far future, but not very concerned with AI risk (the main reason he wouldn&#x2019;t recommend MIRI or FHI).</p><p>Another organization that comes to my mind is <strong>Leverage Research</strong>. I&#x2019;m not sure what category to put them in because they seem to be trying to do a bit of everything. However, I would point out that they appear to be the polar opposites of GiveWell regarding to belief in transparency, with all of the other organizations mentioned above are somewhat in between (with the possible exception of Effective Fundraising). My belief is that their expected method of doing the most good involves having a few smart people spend several years thinking about &#x201C;big issues&#x201D;, without much care for outsider input (you&#x2019;ll notice a lack of much information on their <a href=\"http://www.leverageresearch.org/\">website</a>). These research topics seem to be more psychological and social than AI-risk, from what I understand. Most other EA organizations seem very skeptical of their research posted so far, mainly <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/el9/a_critique_of_leverage_researchs_connection_theory/\">Connection Theory</a>. However, a few people within Leverage run <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">Think!</a>, and they have created the <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/\">Effective Altruist Summit</a>, which has gotten good reviews.\n</p><h2>Future organizations</h2>\nI really hope that the issue of correct epistemology gets resolved and more of these organizations can at least agree on some standard ways of Effective Altruist Organization evaluation. But it seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.<p></p><p>The current trend from my point of view seems to be that every other new prominent Effective Altruist thinker will create a new organization to\nmatch another unique epistemology. I really hope that we don&#x2019;t get stuck with 20 different Charity Evaluators of slightly differing standards and 50 funding groups that randomly give to selections from those different evaluators, and another 10 Far Future groups that will emphasize slightly different things because of unique epistemological reasons. But given the fact that there is so much disagreement within what seems like such a small and intelligent group already, I could definitely see things going this way.</p><p>Granted, this still is a lot better than what is the global cultural norm right now. I would expect that most of the groups above average are far more useful than the global human average. But the global norm is pathetically low, so that shouldn&#x2019;t be considered too important. Within these groups, I&#x2019;d expect that many consider order of magnitude differences between them, so internal fragmentation may cause quite a bit of damage. And it&#x2019;s definitely confusing as anything to a newcomer who just wants to be an &#x201C;Efficient Altruist&#x201D;.\n</p><h3>Personal bias</h3>\nI should point out that I know people from most of the organizations mentioned, so probably am quite biased. I am presently working at 80,000 Hours, which is based in the same office as Giving What we Can, The Center For Effective Altruism, and The Future of Humanity Institute. Recently I applied to and was rejected from working at Leverage Research.\n<h3>Blog efficiency</h3>\nThis post took me about 5 hours to write. I ended up splitting my thoughts into two posts (leaving the rest for one more to come shortly). I&#x2019;ve tracked 4 Pomodoros in this time, but then I just kept on working for a few hours without tracking. I originally intended for this to be about 2 Pomodoros, but this was for a small comment about &#x201C;Epistemology as a Deus Ex Machina&#x201D; rather than a small EA Org overview.<p></p><p>My guess is that I&#x2019;ll dedicate at least another hour or two to checking stats of readership for this post and/or reading/responding to comments.</p><p><em>Crossposted from Ozzie Gooen&apos;s <a href=\"http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/21/navigating-the-epistemologies-of-effective-altruism/\">blog</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"PfcTK4c9oynmQb4Ri":2},"voteCount":0,"baseScore":0,"extendedScore":null,"score":0,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2021-04-17T15:46:53.714Z","name":"Leverage Research","slug":"leverage-research","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Leverage Research</strong> is a nonprofit research institute that conducts research in early stage science.</p><h2 id=\"Funding\">Funding</h2><p>As of June 2022, Leverage Research has received $80,000 in funding from the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topic/survival-and-flourishing\">Survival and Flourishing</a> Fund.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnk36pwttg3p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnk36pwttg3p\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>BayAreaHuman (2021) <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kz9zMgWB5C27Pmdkh/common-knowledge-facts-about-leverage-research-1-0-1\">Common knowledge facts about Leverage Research 1.0</a>, <i>LessWrong</i>, September 24.</p><p>Rowe, Larissa (2021) <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3GgoJ2nCj8PiD4FSi/updates-from-leverage-research-history-and-recent-progress\">Updates from Leverage Research: history and recent progress</a>, <i>LessWrong</i>, September 27.</p><h2 id=\"External_links\">External links</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.leverageresearch.org/\">Leverage Research</a>.

What&#x2019;s more, there&#x2019;s surprisingly little debate about how to answer it. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m excited to see effective altruism gaining traction. I hope this movement generates more debate, in particular about philanthropy and how to do the most good through giving.</p><p>Many people I&#x2019;ve encountered in the philanthropic sector seem to believe this question is impossible to answer or the wrong question to be asking.

It&#x2019;s about a commitment to continuous learning, questioning my assumptions and being open-minded and willing to consider any cause or approach to doing good. We&#x2019;re not perfect at applying these principles, but we try hard, and we&#x2019;re drawn to other people and organizations who do the same.</p><p>Effective altruists engage seriously with the question of how to do the most good through giving.

It&#x2019;s the goal of our <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/\">partnership with GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/co-funding-with-the-gates-foundation\">co-funding projects</a> with more experienced foundations. Sharing is an essential part of learning. If we can&#x2019;t share the information we&#x2019;re collecting publicly, it becomes less valuable to us, because it only has the potential to inform our decisions rather than the giving of any interested donor. We still find private conversations useful and choose to keep information confidential at times. But we aim to share as much as we can &#x2014; via our website or GiveWell&#x2019;s &#x2014; and our ability to share the details of our work is a factor we weigh heavily when making grant decisions.</p><p>We hope our approach bolsters the effective altruism movement by providing other donors with useful information and encouraging them to share as much as they can in turn. We hope to meet more people who are engaging seriously with the question of how to do the most good through giving. We don&#x2019;t expect the effective altruism community to converge around a single answer. We expect quite the opposite: more debate, faster learning and iteration, and more and better answers to the question of which charitable causes and approaches to philanthropy hold the most promise for improving our world.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":1,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000004472462010358105,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"2qCiTg55dekGr27iT","postedAt":"2013-10-01T04:00:57.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"Creating a world with more effective charitable giving","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":null,"pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2qCiTg55dekGr27iT/creating-a-world-with-more-effective-charitable-giving","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>I recently wrote a book, <em>Reinventing Philanthropy: A Framework for More Effective Giving</em>, which has just been released. I hope it is a valuable contribution to the effective altruism movement.</p><p>The genesis of the book stemmed from wondering why the vast majority of charitable giving goes to mediocre causes. It seemed almost self-evident to me that charitable donations should be done in the way that provides the greatest expected benefit for the world. But this clearly isn&#x2019;t obvious to everyone, as demonstrated by the charitable giving behavior of most donors. If I wanted to influence people to give to more effective causes, I needed to understand the obstacles and directly address them. Some of these obstacles include:</p><p>1. Most people are not honest with themselves about the tension between giving to the causes they are personally connected to and having a high impact. It shouldn&#x2019;t take much thought to realize that restricting your giving to only a small set of causes&#x2014;the university you attended, health-related causes that impacted your family, and charities in your neighborhood&#x2014;is likely to exclude the most high-impact areas. But donors often don&#x2019;t think like this. They need a resource to help change their mindset.</p><p>2. Most professionals in the nonprofit and philanthropy industry are unwilling to challenge donors to think hard. Society is reluctant to question the current practice that charitable giving is primarily &#x201C;heart&#x201D; and very little &#x201C;head.&#x201D; The idea of ranking charities by the amount of good they do makes people uncomfortable. They find it awkward to provide criticism of donors, even those who give to mediocre charities; all donors get praised, as they did more good than if they spent the money on themselves. There needs to be open debate about the existing norms of charitable giving in more high-profile forums.</p><p>3. There are few resources for effective altruists. People who want to pursue charitable giving with an EA mindset must carve their own path. The largest charity rating agencies continue to assign scores virtually unrelated to the quality of the charities&#x2019; results. There are a very small number of charity evaluators that approach giving with an EA mindset, and those that exist (like GiveWell) are still in their infancy and not well known. If you don&#x2019;t agree with their approach, then it is excruciatingly difficult to do alternative research yourself. There needs to be more resources to help donors who want to maximize the impact of their giving.</p><p>I thought that writing a book on charitable giving may be able to address each of these issues and break down barriers to improve the effectiveness of charitable giving. My book attempts to provide donors with an honest, authentic perspective on charitable giving to help them understand how their giving decisions affect the impact of their donations. It challenges the norms of giving and provides a more robust way for donors to approach how they decide where to donate money. Hopefully, it will influence readers to want to pursue higher impact strategies and gives them some of the tools to start doing so.</p><p>The first chapter of the book is available for free on <a href=\"http://reinventingphilanthropy.com/excerpt/\">my website</a>.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{},"voteCount":0,"baseScore":0,"extendedScore":null,"score":0,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[]},{"_id":"bfDSdjECxd5aE6uG2","postedAt":"2013-10-16T16:07:52.800Z","modifiedAt":"2021-09-27T19:53:21.286Z","title":"Geoengineering Research","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2022-01-17T21:51:06.169Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bfDSdjECxd5aE6uG2/geoengineering-research","htmlBody":"<p><i>Note: Before the launch of the Open Philanthropy Project Blog, this post appeared on the </i><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/\"><i>GiveWell Blog</i></a><i>. Uses of “we” and “our” in the below post may refer to the Open Philanthropy Project or to GiveWell as an organization. Additional comments may be available at the </i><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/10/16/geoengineering-research/\"><i>original post</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>We’ve completed a medium-depth writeup on <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/global-catastrophic-risks/geoengineering\">geoengineering research</a> - large-scale interventions in the climate to attempt to reduce climate change or its impacts - focusing on research around efforts to artificially cool the planet. This writeup outlines the basic case for why geoengineering research might be a promising cause for philanthropy, as well as listing all of the funded projects we know of in a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/shallow/geoengineering/Geoengineering%20research%20funding%2010-9-13.xls\">spreadsheet</a>. It is a medium-depth, rather than shallow-depth, investigation, in that it involved many conversations and represents our attempt to speak to a broad, representative set of relevant people (rather than the 1-3 conversations that typically constitute a shallow-depth investigation). With that said, it leaves many questions unanswered, and leaves us a fair distance from having a confident view on the value of philanthropic investment in geoengineering.</p><p>In this post, we first summarize why we’ve looked into geoengineering, what we’ve learned about it, and what we see as the pros and cons of geoengineering as a philanthropic cause. We then address a series of meta-questions: why are we pausing our investigation here? What would it look like to do a deeper investigation? What is a reasonable goal for a medium-depth investigation? Making progress on these sorts of questions is a key goal of our current ongoing research, which is why we’ve gone ahead with some medium-depth investigations of causes that we’ve had only very preliminary reasons to be interested in.</p><h1>Why did we investigate geoengineering?</h1><p>We’ve previously completed a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/policy/anthropogenic-climate-change\">shallow investigation of climate change</a>, which concluded that (a) there is a substantial amount of giving around climate change mitigation; (b) one of the most concerning aspects of climate change is the uncertainty around forecasts of potential effects, which cannot rule out the possibility that climate change could be far more catastrophic than mainstream projections anticipate.</p><p>At the same time, we had read about the possibility of <i>geoengineering</i>: a broad term for large-scale efforts to modify the climate, which (a) was alleged to be overlooked by traditional environmental funders and nonprofits; (b) could be extremely risky but could also conceivably be our best option if facing a far-worse-than-anticipated catastrophe. As of the time when we completed our shallow investigation of climate change, geoengineering research was the most promising-seeming aspect of climate change philanthropy we had identified, based on the combination of having little attention from philanthropists and of having potentially crucial importance in the worst case. Because of this, and because climate change is one of the causes most widely held to be of paramount importance, we decided to put some further time into investigating geoengineering research as a philanthropic cause.</p><p>After a number of conversations with experts in the field, and attending a conference devoted to geoengineering research, we feel that our initial narrative of limited funding and potentially large importance continues to hold up. However, there are many questions that we would like to answer before committing funding to the field, and we expect that they will be fairly difficult and time-consuming to answer. We accordingly decided to pause and write up our current views.</p><h1>What have we learned?</h1><p>Details are at <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/global-catastrophic-risks/geoengineering\">our writeup</a>. In a nutshell:</p><ul><li>We focused on a particular category of geoengineering, solar radiation management, that we perceive as riskier, potentially faster and cheaper (and thus more useful in a severe catastrophe), and less well-funded than the other major category (carbon dioxide removal).</li><li>It appears that this type of geoengineering could bring extreme risks, both environmental and political (through e.g. disputes over who has the right to intervene in the global environment). Funding research into it could conceivably do major harm by causing it to be perceived as a more viable option by policymakers.</li><li>At the same time, it is plausible that, in the event of a far-worse-than-projected climate-change-related catastrophe, this type of geoengineering could relatively quickly halt or reverse global warming. Better information about the costs, benefits, and best methods of implementation could therefore be highly valuable in such an event.</li><li>We haven’t found any funders - governmental or philanthropic - spending large amounts in this area now, and the field appears relatively small with relatively little in funding. (Our attempt to identify funded projects and funding sources around the world that explicitly include a significant solar geoengineering component came up with a total of about $11 million/year in funding, though we believe that figure is more likely than not to underestimate the total resources devoted to solar geoengineering research.)</li><li>There also doesn’t appear to be much in the way of “shovel-ready” funding opportunities, and it isn’t immediately clear how a funder would contribute to the field. Promoting more discussion of <i>whether</i> geoengineering research should be expanded - and how to handle the governance issues (e.g., who has the right to carry out experiments that may affect the global climate) - could be a better strategy than simply funding more research. A funder’s involvement in this area could be in the category of “field-building” - funding and organizing convenings and encouraging more people to enter the field - rather than supporting existing organizations.</li></ul><h1>Pros and cons of geoengineering research as a philanthropic cause</h1><p>We see major reasons to be positive on the value of geoengineering as a philanthropic cause, and major reasons to be negative.</p><h2>Positive:</h2><ul><li>The relative lack of existing philanthropic (and governmental) funding is striking. When comparing geoengineering research to other <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports\">causes we’ve done shallow investigations on</a> (including those in progress), the total dollars in the area seem very low, and the dollars are spread out among an assortment of funders.</li><li>Climate change is one of the most compelling <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/possible-global-catastrophic-risks\">global catastrophic risks</a> we’re aware of, and in the event that climate change is far more catastrophic than currently projected, it seems that having better information on geoengineering could make a crucial difference - whether that information <i>enables and improves</i> geoengineering (which could be the only viable option for mitigating global catastrophe) or whether it <i>prevents</i> geoengineering from being carried out (by strengthening the case that the costs outweigh the benefits).</li><li>As a more minor point, it isn’t necessarily the case that better information about geoengineering will be fully useless in a more “normal” (closer to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/impacts\">mainstream projections</a>) scenario. Studying the methods and consequences of intervening in the global climate could produce insights with a variety of applications.</li></ul><h2>Negative:</h2><ul><li>The experts we spoke with were not uniformly encouraging about the value of getting involved in this space, and in some cases expressed ambivalence on the basis that increased attention for geoengineering could cause harm by (a) making risky geoengineering interventions more likely; (b) lowering the perceived importance of carbon emissions reduction. We’re extremely wary of getting involved in any cause in which some of the people with the most inside knowledge are ambivalent/less-than-enthusiastically-positive about seeing a new funder enter.</li><li>The case for geoengineering research being important hinges on a highly specific long-term set of conditions. It hinges on the idea that our involvement now would cause more progress on generating useful information than would be achieved otherwise over a very long time frame (a risky proposition since improved technological tools and greater attention to the issue in the future could swamp what can be accomplished in earlier years); that climate change presents enough of a problem in the fairly far future for geoengineering research to be relevant; and that the marginal “useful information generated” by philanthropy over the next few years turns out to be important for policymakers.</li></ul><h1>Why are we pausing our investigation here?</h1><p>The general principle we’re trying to follow with investigations is, “Pause an investigation when the effort required to significantly improve our understanding is significantly beyond the effort we’ve put in so far.” For our <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports\">shallow</a> investigations, we generally talk to 1-3 people; for medium-depth investigation, we generally try to talk to enough people to create a preliminary landscape of the cause. In the case of geoengineering, the cost of achieving the latter relative to the former seemed relatively small, so we went ahead. But from here, substantially improving our understanding would likely have to mean gaining a deep understanding of the scientific and/or political issues, which could take months or even years, and the returns to a few more conversations seem unlikely to be high.</p><h1>What would it look like to do a deeper investigation?</h1><p>It seems to us that a funder in this area would have to make difficult judgment calls about controversial questions, such as whether the benefits of more discussion around geoengineering outweigh the costs. This is the sort of endeavor that we feel is likely to require true subject-matter expertise, and for that reason the next step in investigating geoengineering would likely to be to seek out a full-time employee to specialize in it, or to hire someone who already has considerable expertise. This is consistent with our strategy, described <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewell-labs-update-0\">earlier this year</a>, of focusing our efforts on finding <i>causes</i> to recommend developing philanthropic capacity in, rather than on finding <i>projects</i> to recommend funding directly.</p><p>We are currently experimenting with working with a consultant (who has a substantial relevant background) to make more progress on this cause.</p><h1>What is a reasonable goal for a medium-depth investigation?</h1><p>We’ve been eager to move forward with investigations of causes that seem unusually promising to us, even if they seem promising for highly intuitive and not very thoroughly researched reasons. This is because we are seeking to learn about <i>what to expect from an investigation</i> as much as we’re seeking to learn about the causes themselves.</p><p>In this case, we feel that coming to a bottom line on <i>whether</i> and <i>how</i> a philanthropist could accomplish good by supporting geoengineering-related activities would take a great deal more investigation - so much so that it likely requires at least one dedicated full-time person over an extended period of time. In other words, we don’t feel that a medium-depth investigation has been sufficient to identify or assess specific giving opportunities.</p><p>However, we think the medium-depth investigation <i>has</i> given us important information that will be useful in determining the value of a deeper (full-time-person) investigation. We’ve established a more confident view that geoengineering is in some sense a “neglected” area of philanthropy; we’ve established that funding it would likely require a “field building” type effort rather than simply supporting existing organizations that are already ready to scale; we’ve established that there is controversy within the field and that an investigation would have to be thorough and careful in order to reach a well-grounded bottom line on whether and how to get involved.</p><p>Armed with this level of information about many causes, a funder would be able to make much more informed decisions about which causes to make commitments to (whether in the form of hiring people to investigate them more deeply, or in the form of funding existing organizations, or both). This doesn’t mean that there would be any particular formula for making provably, or quantifiably, optimal decisions, but it does mean that such decisions would likely be more <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/08/passive-vs-rational-vs-quantified/\">rational</a> than the way most funders choose causes.

Yet it is also hard to make a very strong case that they are better than a huge number of other activities. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/\">changing policy discourse in China</a>, <a href=\"http://www.coolearth.org/\">averting rainforest deforestation</a> or <a href=\"http://openborders.info/\">pushing for US immigration reform</a>.</p><p>There are also (at least in theory) endeavors that can be reasonably expected to be much better than anything else available.

Another is that the first plan involves engaging quite a different demographic to the second, and probably in a different way. Finally, the second plan requires intellectual standards that can actually filter out the plausible endeavors from the very good ones. Such standards seem hard to develop and maintain. Upholding norms that filter terrible interventions from plausible ones is plenty of work, and probably easier.</p><p>My own intuition has been that most of the value will come from the second possibility. However I suspect others have the opposite feeling, or at least aim to exploit the first possibility more at the moment. What do you think?

Suffering reducers may want to help mitigate the arms race for AI so that AI developers take fewer risks and have more time to plan for how to avert suffering that may result from the AI's computations. The AI-focused work of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI) seems to be one important way to tackle this issue. I suggest some other, broader approaches, like advancing philosophical sophistication, cosmopolitan perspective, and social institutions for cooperation.</p>\n<p>As a general heuristic, it seems like advancing technology may be net negative, though there are plenty of exceptions depending on the specific technology in question. Probably advancing social science is generally net positive. Humanities and pure natural sciences can also be positive but probably less per unit of effort than social sciences, which come logically prior to everything else.

He argues that we need to change our views of what is involved in living an ethical life. To help us play our part in bringing about that change, he offers a seven-point plan that mixes personal philanthropy (figuring how much to give and how best to give it), local activism (spreading the word in your community), and political awareness (contacting your representatives to ensure that your nation&#x2019;s foreign aid is really directed to the world&#x2019;s poorest people).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Poverty</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Poor-Economics-Barefoot-Hedge-fund-Surprising/dp/0718193660/\">Poor Economics</a></em> - Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo\nTells which choices poor people actually make and what really helps to alleviate poverty (it&apos;s evidence based, unlike a lot of other ideological books on poverty).</li>\n\t<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scarcity-having-little-means-much/dp/1846143454/\">Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much</a></em> - Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir\nIt&apos;s about how scarcity affects you psychologically and why people suffering from it (e.g. poor people or people with a high work load) make &quot;irrational&quot; choices.</li>\n\t<li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Living-High-Letting-Die-Innocence/dp/0195108590/\">Living High and Letting Die: Our Illusion of Innocence</a></em> - Peter Unger\nFeatures many thought experiments trying to establish that our moral obligations to relieving poverty are not lessened by the commonly proposed reasons.

The risk is then that you make something that no-one wants. The lean startup movement provides an alternative - as you set up your company you should be testing hypotheses and changing plans as you get more information. These two books have become widely used in tech startups. <em>The Lean Startup</em> is good as an introduction, and <em>Four Steps to the Epiphany</em> contains a detailed step-by-step process for actually doing it.

We gave a detailed answer that we thought we might as well share with others, who may also find our perspective interesting. We gave the answer largely in hope of creating some interest in our way of thinking about philanthropy and some of the causes that we find interesting for further investigation, and because we thought the answer would be fruitful for conversation.\n<h2>Our honest answer to your question</h2>\nOur honest answer to your question is that we would systematically examine a wide variety of causes and opportunities with the intention of identifying the ones which could use additional money and talent to produce the best long-run outcomes. This would look a lot like setting up a major foundation--which is unsurprising, given that many people in this situation do set up foundations--so we will concentrate on the distinguishing or less typical features of our approach:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Unlike many foundations, we would place a great deal of emphasis on selecting the highest impact program areas, rather than selecting program areas for other reasons and working hardest to find the best opportunities within those areas. Like <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\">GiveWell</a>, we believe that the choice of program areas may be one of the most important decisions a major philanthropist makes and is consistently underemphasized.</li>\n\t<li>We would invest heavily in learning, funding systematic examination of the spectrum of opportunities, and the transparent publication of our process and findings.</li>\n\t<li>In addition to sharing information about giving opportunities, we would share detailed information about talent gaps, encouraging people with the right abilities to seek out opportunities in promising areas that are constrained by people rather than money.</li>\n\t<li>We would measure impact primarily in terms of very long-run positive consequences for humanity, as outlined in <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research\">Nick&#x2019;s PhD thesis</a>.</li>\n\t<li>We would be skeptical of our intuitions, and check them through such means as external review, the collection of track records for our predictions, structured evaluations, and the use of simple and sophisticated methods of aggregating and improving on expert opinion (e.g. the forecasting training and aggregation methods developed by Philip Tetlock, calibration training, prediction markets, and anonymous surveys of appropriate experts).</li>\n</ol>\nWe understand that you probably aren&#x2019;t contacting us about setting up a foundation, though you might be interested in hearing more about the approach and assumptions above, so we&#x2019;ll say a few things about how we would go about strategically selecting causes, and our leading hypotheses about which causes are most promising to investigate further.<p></p><p>Briefly,\n</p><ol>\n\t<li><strong>We believe that maximizing good accomplished largely reduces to doing what is best in terms of very long-run outcomes for humanity.</strong> We think this has significant practical implications when making trade-offs between short-term welfare and the broad functioning of society, our ability to face major global challenges and opportunities, and increasing society&#x2019;s resilience to global catastrophes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Five causes we are interested in investigating first include immigration reform, methods for improved forecasting, an area we call &#x201C;philanthropic infrastructure,&#x201D; catastrophic risks to humanity, and research integrity.</strong> These would be areas for investigation and experimentation, and we would pursue them in the short run primarily for the sake of gaining information about how attractive they are in comparison with other areas. There many other causes we would like to investigate early on, and would begin investigating those causes less deeply and in parallel with our investigations of the causes we are most enthusiastic about. We&#x2019;d be happy to discuss the other causes with you as well.</li>\n</ol>\nWe elaborate on these ideas below.\n<h2>Is the long run actionable in the short run?</h2>\nAs just mentioned, we believe that maximizing good accomplished largely reduces to doing what is best in terms of very long-run outcomes for humanity, and that this has strategic implications for people aiming to maximize good accomplished with their resources. We think these implications are significant when choosing between causes or program areas, and less significant when comparing opportunities within program areas.<p></p><p>There is a lot of detail behind this perspective and it is hard to summarize briefly. But here is an attempt to quickly explain our reasoning:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>We think humanity has a reasonable probability of lasting a very long time, becoming very large, and/or eventually enjoying a very high quality of life. This could happen through radical (or even moderate) technological change, if industrial civilization persists as long as agriculture has persisted (though upper limits for life on Earth are around a billion years), or if future generations colonize other regions of space. Though we wouldn&#x2019;t bet on very specific details, we think some of these possibilities have a reasonable probability of occurring.</li>\n\t<li>Because of this, we think that, from an impartial perspective, almost all of the potential good we can accomplish comes through influencing very long-run outcomes for humanity.</li>\n\t<li>We believe long-run outcomes may be highly sensitive to how well humanity handles key challenges and opportunities, especially challenges from new technology, in the next hundred years or so.</li>\n\t<li>We believe that (especially with substantial resources) we could have small but significant positive impacts on how effectively we face these challenges and opportunities, and thereby affect expected long-run outcomes for humanity.</li>\n\t<li>We could face these challenges and opportunities more effectively by preparing for specific challenges and opportunities (such as nuclear security and climate change in the past and present, and advances in synthetic biology and artificial intelligence in the future), or by enhancing humanity&#x2019;s general capacities to deal with these challenges and opportunities when we face them (through higher rates of economic growth, improved political coordination, improved use of information and decision-making for individuals and groups, and increases in education and human capital).</li>\n</ol>\n&#xA0;<p></p><p>We believe that this perspective diverges from the recommendations of a more short-run focus in a few ways.</p><p>First, when we consider attempts to prepare for global challenges and opportunities in general, we weigh such factors as economic output, log incomes, education, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), scientific progress, and governance quality differently than if we would if we put less emphasis on long-run outcomes for humanity. In particular, a more short-term focus would lead to a much stronger emphasis on QALYs and log incomes, which we suspect could be purchased more cheaply through interventions targeting people in developing countries, e.g. through public health or more open migration. Attending to long-run impacts creates a closer contest between such interventions and those which increase economic output or institutional quality (and thus the quality of our response to future challenges and opportunities). &#xA0;Our perspective would place an especially high premium on intermediate goals such as the quality of forecasting and the transmission of scientific knowledge to policy makers, which are disproportionately helpful for navigating global challenges and opportunities.</p><p>Second, when there are opportunities for identifying specific major challenges or opportunities for affecting long-run outcomes for humanity, our perspective favors treating these challenges and opportunities with the utmost seriousness. We believe that reducing the risk of catastrophes with the potential to destroy humanity--which we call &#x201C;global catastrophic risks&#x201D; or sometimes &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">existential risks</a>&#x201D;--has an unusually clear and positive connection with long-run outcomes, and this is a reason we are unusually interested in problems in this area.</p><p>Third, the long-run perspective values resilience against permanent disruption or worsening of civilization over and above resilience to short-term catastrophe. From a long-run perspective, there is an enormous difference between a collapse of civilization followed by eventual recovery, versus a permanent collapse of civilization. This point has been made by philosophers like Derek Parfit (very memorably at the end of his book Reasons and Persons) and Peter Singer (in a <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/preventing-human-extinction\">short piece</a> he wrote with Nick Beckstead and Matt Wage).\n</p><h2>Five causes we would like to investigate more deeply</h2>\n<h3>Immigration reform</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: By &#x201C;immigration reform,&#x201D; we mean loosening immigration restrictions in rich countries with stronger political institutions, especially for people who are migrating from poor countries with weaker political institutions. We include both efforts to allow more high-skill immigration and efforts to allow more immigration in general. Some people to talk to in this area include Michael Clemens, Lant Pritchett, and others at the Center for Global Development. Fwd.us and the Krieble Foundation are two examples of organizations working in this area.<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: Many individual workers in poor countries could produce much more economic value and better realize their potential in other ways if they lived in rich countries, meaning that much of the world&#x2019;s human capital is being severely underutilized. This claim is unusually well supported by basic economic theory and the views of a large majority of economists. Many concerns have been raised, but we think the most plausible ones involve political feasibility and political and cultural consequences of migration.\n</p><h3>Philanthropic infrastructure</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: By &#x201C;philanthropic infrastructure,&#x201D; we mean activities that expand the flexible capabilities of those trying to do good in a cause-neutral, outcome-oriented way. Some organizations in this area we are most familiar with include charity evaluator GiveWell, donation pledge organizations (Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, the Giving Pledge), and 80,000 Hours (an organization that provides information to help people make career choices that maximize their impact). There are many examples we are less familiar with, such as the Bridgespan Group and the Center for Effective Philanthropy. (Disclosure: Nick Beckstead is on the board of trustees for the Centre for Effective Altruism, which houses Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, and 80,000 Hours, though The Life You Can Save is substantially independent.)<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: We are interested in this area because we want to build up resources which are flexible enough to ultimately support the causes and opportunities that are later found to be the most promising, and because we see a lot of growth in this area and think early investments may result in more money and talent available for very promising opportunities later on.\n</p><h3>Methods for improved forecasting</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: Forecasting is challenging, and very high accuracy is difficult to obtain in many of the domains of greatest interest. However, a number of methods have been developed to improve forecasting accuracy through training, aggregation of opinion, incentives, and other means. Some examples include expert judgment aggregation algorithms, probability and calibration training, and prediction markets. &#xA0;We are excited about recent progress in this area in a prediction tournament sponsored by IARPA, which Philip Tetlock&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://goodjudgmentproject.com/blog/\">Good Judgment Project</a> is currently winning.<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: Improved forecasting could be useful in a wide variety of political and business contexts. Improved forecasting over a period of multiple years could improve overall preparedness for many global challenges and opportunities. Moreover, strong evidence of the superior performance of some methods of forecasting over others could help policymakers base decisions on the best available evidence. We currently have limited information about room for more funding for existing organizations in this area.\n</p><h3>Global catastrophic risk</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: Opportunities in this area focus on identifying and mitigating specific threats of human extinction, such as large asteroid impact and tail risks of climate change and nuclear winter. Examples of interventions in this category include tracking asteroids (which has largely been completed for asteroids that threaten civilization, though not for comets), improving resilience of the food supply through <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/18/7182\">cellulose-to-food conversion</a>, disease surveillance (for natural or man-made pandemics), advocacy for non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and research on other possible risks and methods for mitigating them. An unusual view we take seriously is that some of the most significant risks in this area will come from new technologies that may emerge this century, such as advanced artificial intelligence and advanced biological weapons. (We also believe technologies of this type have massive upside potential which must be thought about carefully as we think about the risks.) Notable defenders of views in this vicinity include Martin Rees, Richard Posner, and Nick Bostrom. (Disclosure: Nick Bostrom is the Director at the Future of Humanity Institute, where Nick Beckstead is a research fellow and Carl Shulman is a research associate.)<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: Progress in this area has a clear relationship with long-run outcomes for humanity. There have been some very good buys in this area in the past, such as early asteroid tracking programs. Apart from climate change, total foundation spending in this area is around <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/08/what-large-scale-philanthropy-focuses-on-today/\">0.1%</a>, and little of that carefully distinguishes between large catastrophes and catastrophes with the potential to significant change long-run outcomes for humanity.\n</p><h3>Meta-research</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: We will make use of GiveWell&#x2019;s explanation of the cause area <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/11/meta-research/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/06/meta-research-update/\">here</a>.<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: We believe that many improvements in meta-research can accelerate scientific progress and make it easier for non-experts to discern what is known in a field. We believe this is likely to systematically improve our ability to navigate global challenges and opportunities. From a long-term perspective the importance of different impacts of meta-research diverges from a short-term analysis because, e.g. the degree to which policymakers can understand the state of scientific knowledge at any given level of progress looms larger in comparison to simple acceleration of progress.</p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"psBzwdY8ipfCeExJ7":2,"wPjsmKwAoW8XhBEzE":2},"voteCount":10,"baseScore":18,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000162,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:38:21.092Z","name":"Cause prioritization","slug":"cause-prioritization","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Cause prioritization</strong> refers to efforts to find the most important causes to work on and compare interventions across different areas, so that we can do as much good as possible with the resources available to us.</p><p>Governments and philanthropists spend considerable resources attempting to do good in the world. <i>How</i> those resources are used, however, can make an even bigger difference than <i>how many</i> resources are available.

Additional comments may be available at the </i><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/06/the-track-record-of-policy-oriented-philanthropy/\"><i>original post</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>As noted <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/exploring-policy-oriented-philanthropy\">previously</a>, I’ve been working on improving our broad understanding of the role that philanthropy can play in influencing and informing policy. One of the questions I’ve been focused on is “What is the track record of policy-oriented philanthropy?” Specifically:</p><ul><li>Are there compelling cases in which a major policy change can be partially or fully credited to philanthropic efforts?</li><li>How often have philanthropic efforts succeeded in bringing about change? Often enough to imply a good “return on investment?”</li></ul><p>I’ve concluded that <strong>answering these questions reasonably well could require an enormous, long-term effort</strong>. This is true both because the questions are inherently difficult to answer - many of philanthropy’s claimed impacts on politics are highly long-term and diffuse, such that it is difficult to confidently isolate impact - and because there has been little academic work on the subject.</p><p>Below, I first list salient examples I’ve seen in which philanthropy is believed (by some) to have had an important impact on public policy. I think the nature of these examples illustrates some of the challenges with isolating the impact of philanthropy. I then discuss our understanding of the current state of the literature on this topic, and what we would do to make more progress. <strong>For the purposes of this post only, “success” is defined as causally impacting public policy, </strong><i><strong>not</strong></i><strong> as having positive social impact,</strong> since the goal is to determine how and when philanthropy has been effective in changing policy (the question of <i>how</i> policy should be changed is a different question).</p><h1>Potential cases of philanthropic impact on public policy</h1><p>Many of the claimed success stories of policy-oriented philanthropy involve long-term (sometimes 10+ years), diffuse impacts. Pages 4-8 of <a href=\"http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/documents/Elusive_Craft.pdf\">The Elusive Craft of Evaluating Advocacy</a>, by Steven Teles and Mark Schmitt (both of whom we’ve spoken with - see conversations notes for <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Teles%206-12-13%20(public).pdf\">Teles</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Schmitt%202013%20(public).pdf\">Schmitt</a>) give a good feel for this kind of story, and cover some of the cases we’ve frequently heard reference to: the role of Atlantic Philanthropies and others in laying the groundwork for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act\">Affordable Care Act</a>, the role of (presumably philanthropy-backed) church and student groups in “claw[ing] back the application of the death penalty,” the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, and impact of the conservative Federalist Society, which is claimed to have magnified the impact of other organizations on law. We excerpt the part about health care reform, as an example:</p><blockquote><p><i>The effort that culminated in 2010 was the work of decades, including a previous, high-profile failure in the early 1990s, multiple waves of state-based reform and numerous incremental efforts at the national level. Advocates invested hundreds of millions of dollars on initiatives ranging from media initiatives such as encouraging television producers to include stories of the uninsured, multiple coalition-building projects, university- and think tank-based research and well-funded grassroots initiatives. The basic outlines of reform policies were worked out well in advance, in advocacy groups and think tanks, who delivered a workable plan to presidential candidates. Key interest groups who could block reform, such as small business, had been part of foundation-supported roundtables seeking common ground for years. Technical problems had been worked out. And tens of millions of dollars had been set aside as long ago as 2007 for politically savvy grassroots advocacy initiatives targeted at key legislators. After a very long slog, the outcome was the Affordable Care Act.</i></p></blockquote><p>Another very long-term, diffuse impact that has been cited to us is the case of <a href=\"http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/evaluations/2011/rwjf70005\">the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s efforts to reduce tobacco use</a>.</p><ul><li>Activities included funding research on the impact of policy on tobacco use (page 13), funding early-career researchers in the hopes of developing a stronger set of professionals focused on the issue (page 17), creating the <a href=\"http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/\">Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids</a> (page 17), and indirect support for state-level lobbying (page 20).</li><li>The program started in 1991 and had reached ~$20 million per year by 1993 (page 12), but its goals - changing policy to be more discouraging of tobacco use and ultimately reducing smoking rates, particularly among minors - don’t seem to have shown much progress until after 1996 (see pages 36-38 for policy change indicators, page 26 for smoking rate data).</li><li>Given the number of different initiatives RWJF created and invested in, the number of states it worked in, and the long-term nature of some of its investments (building organizations, funding research and researchers), evaluating the extent to which its funding can be “credited” for reductions in tobacco use could be an extremely challenging project.</li><li>The Foundation spent ~$700 million in this area over time (page 12); if one assumes it reduced the number of smokers by 10 million (its evaluation estimates 5.3-14.2 million, page 28), then the total cost of the program was ~$70 per “person stopped from smoking,” which would compare favorably to our <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/\">estimate of ~$80 per life-year gained for our top charity</a> if <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/putting-a-number-to-smokings-toll/?_r=0\">smoking causes one to lose multiple years of life</a>. The point of this calculation isn’t to praise the program - we haven’t vetted these figures and realize there are a substantial number of questions here - but to illustrate that the sort of claims made about policy impact imply potential competitiveness with our top charities.</li></ul><p>We have also seen claims of shorter-term, more tangible impact of funders and nonprofits on public policy, though usually at smaller scale. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Change-Philanthropy-Stories-Foundations-Maximizing/dp/047043516X\">Change Philanthropy</a> goes through several such cases, including a movement in which lawsuits were brought against states alleging that they needed to invest more in education to comply with their own constitutions. The <a href=\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/sites/default/files/documents/SuccessStoriesRvsd.pdf\">Center for Lobbying in the Public Interest</a> also lists smaller-scale success stories. I’ve heard multiple informal claims that online advocacy groups had tangible, extremely rapid impact on halting (a) passage of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act\">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> (b) construction of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline\">Keystone XL pipeline</a>.</p><h1>Assessing the ROI of policy-oriented philanthropy</h1><p>While we’ve seen many claims of impact, none appear easy to assess. Moreover, the most prominent and largest-scale claimed impacts generally appear the hardest to evaluate.</p><p>We’ve asked multiple people (including <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Frank%20Baumgartner%2005-03-13%20(public).pdf\">Frank Baumgartner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Schmitt%202013%20(public).pdf\">Mark Schmitt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Teles%206-12-13%20(public).pdf\">Steven Teles</a>) whether there is a literature that might help us in this endeavor. It appears that we aren’t going to find any work systematically looking across a large number of philanthropic efforts to change policy, such that we could get an idea of aggregate return-on-investment. We may be able to find case studies on specific policy changes.</p><p>We don’t see a clear or easy path to assessing the question, “Can policy-oriented philanthropy have a high enough probability of success to make the cost-effectiveness competitive with our <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>?” We expect our <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy\">History of Philanthropy project</a> to generate better information on particular, high-profile claimed successes (perhaps via reviewing existing case studies, perhaps via generating new ones focused on the role of philanthropy). If it does, we may consider a more systematic project aiming to catalogue and investigate the policy-oriented work of a representative set of foundations.

This was part of an attempt to get “in character”. <i>This tone does not indicate my current mental state with regard to the effective altruism movement.</i> I agree, to varying extents, with some of the critiques I present here, but I’m not about to give up on effective altruism or stop cooperating with the EA movement. The apostasy is purely hypothetical.</p><p>Also, because of the nature of a hypothetical apostasy, I’d guess that for effective altruist readers, the critical tone of this piece may be especially likely to trigger defensive rationalization. Please read through with this in mind. (A good way to counteract this effect might be, for instance, to imagine that you’re not an effective altruist, but your friend is, and it’s them reading through it: how should they update their beliefs?)</p><p>(End less relevant paragraphs.)</p><p>Finally, if you’ve never heard of effective altruism before, I don’t recommend making this piece your first impression of it! You’re going to get a very skewed view because I don’t bother to mention all the things that are awesome about the EA movement.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p>Effective altruism is, to my knowledge, the first time that a substantially useful set of ethics and frameworks to analyze one’s effect on the world has gained a broad enough appeal to resemble a social movement. (I’d say these principles are something like <i>altruism</i>, <i>maximization</i>, <i>egalitarianism</i>, and <i>consequentialism</i>; together they imply many improvements over the social default for trying to do good in the world—earning to give as opposed to doing direct charity work, working in the developing world rather than locally, using evidence and feedback to analyze effectiveness, etc.) Unfortunately, as a movement effective altruism is failing to use these principles to acquire correct nontrivial beliefs about how to improve the world.</p><p>By way of clarification, consider a distinction between two senses of the word “trying” I used above. Let’s call them “actually trying” and “pretending to try”. Pretending to try to improve the world is something like responding to social pressure to improve the world by querying your brain for a thing which improves the world, taking the first search result and rolling with it. For example, for a while I thought that I would try to improve the world by developing computerized methods of checking informally-written proofs, thus allowing more scalable teaching of higher math, democratizing education, etc. <i>Coincidentally</i>, computer programming and higher math happened to be the two things that I was best at. This is pretending to try. Actually trying is looking at the things that improve the world, figuring out which one maximizes utility, and then doing that thing. For instance, I now run an effective altruist student organization at Harvard because I realized that even though I’m a comparatively bad leader and don’t enjoy it very much, it’s still very high-impact if I work hard enough at it. This isn’t to say that I’m actually trying yet, but I’ve gotten closer.</p><p>Using this distinction between pretending and actually trying, I would summarize a lot of effective altruism as “pretending to actually try”. As a social group, effective altruists have successfully noticed the pretending/actually-trying distinction. But they seem to have stopped there, assuming that knowing the difference between fake trying and actually trying translates into ability to actually try. Empirically, it most certainly doesn’t. A lot of effective altruists still end up satisficing—finding actions that are on their face acceptable under core EA standards and then picking those which seem appealing because of other essentially random factors. This is more likely to converge on good actions than what society does by default, because the principles are better than society’s default principles. Nevertheless, it fails to make much progress over what is directly obvious from the core EA principles. As a result, although “doing effective altruism” feels like truth-seeking, it often ends up being just a more credible way to pretend to try.</p><p>Below I introduce various ways in which effective altruists have failed to go beyond the social-satisficing algorithm of establishing some credibly acceptable alternatives and then picking among them based on essentially random preferences. I exhibit other areas where the norms of effective altruism fail to guard against motivated cognition. Both of these phenomena add what I call “epistemic inertia” to the effective-altruist consensus: effective altruists become more subject to pressures on their beliefs other than those from a truth-seeking process, meaning that the EA consensus becomes less able to update on new evidence or arguments and preventing the movement from moving forward. I argue that this stems from effective altruists’ reluctance to think through issues of the form “being a successful social movement” rather than “correctly applying utilitarianism individually”. This could potentially be solved by introducing an additional principle of effective altruism—e.g. “group self-awareness”—but it may be too late to add new things to effective altruism’s DNA.</p><h2>Philosophical difficulties</h2><p>There is <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/protecting-acro.html\">currently</a> <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/\">wide</a> <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/hedonistic-vs-preference.html\">disagreement</a> <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html\">among</a> <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/91/average_utilitarianism_must_be_correct/\">effective</a> <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/03/my-outlook/comment-page-1/#comment-445\">altruists</a> on the correct framework for population ethics. This is crucially important for determining the best way to improve the world: different population ethics can lead to drastically different choices (or at least so we would expect <i>a priori</i>), and if the EA movement can’t converge on at least their instrumental goals, it will quickly fragment and lose its power. Yet there has been little progress towards discovering the correct population ethics (or, from a moral anti-realist standpoint, constructing arguments that will lead to convergence on a particular population ethics), or even determining which ethics lead to which interventions being better.</p><h2>Poor cause choices</h2><p>Many effective altruists donate to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell’s</a> top charities. All three of these charities work in global health. Is that because GiveWell knows that global health is the highest-leverage cause? No. It’s because it was the only one with enough data to say anything very useful about. There’s little reason to suppose that this correlates with being particularly high-leverage—on the contrary, heuristic but less rigorous arguments for causes like <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2013/06/05/friendly-ai-research-as-effective-altruism/\">existential risk prevention</a>, <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/\">vegetarian advocacy</a> and <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/open-borders-in-at-least-one-developed.html\">open borders</a> suggest that these could be even more efficient.</p><p>Furthermore, the our current “best known intervention” is likely to change (in a more cost-effective direction) in the future. There are two competing effects here: we might discover better interventions to donate to than the ones we currently think are best, but we also might run out of opportunities for the current best known intervention, and have to switch to the second. So far we seem to be in a regime where the first effect dominates, and there’s no evidence that we’ll reach a tipping point very soon, especially given how new the field of effective charity research is.</p><p>Given these considerations, it’s quite surprising that effective altruists are donating to global health causes now. Even for those looking to use their donations to set an example, a donor-advised fund would have many of the benefits and none of the downsides. And anyway, donating when you believe it’s not (except for example-setting) the best possible course of action, in order to make a point about figuring out the best possible course of action and then doing that thing, seems perverse.</p><h2>Non-obviousness</h2><p>Effective altruists often express surprise that the idea of effective altruism only came about so recently. For instance, my student group recently hosted Elie Hassenfeld for a talk in which he made remarks to that effect, and I’ve heard other people working for EA organizations express the same sentiment. But no one seems to be actually worried about this—just smug that they’ve figured out something that no one else had.</p><p>The “market” for ideas is at least somewhat efficient: most simple, obvious and correct things get thought of fairly quickly after it’s possible to think them. If a meme as simple as effective altruism hasn’t taken root yet, we should at least try to understand why before throwing our weight behind it. The absence of such attempts—in other words, the fact that non-obviousness doesn’t make effective altruists worried that they’re missing something—is a strong indicator against the “effective altruists are actually trying” hypothesis.</p><h2>Efficient markets for giving</h2><p>It’s often claimed that “nonprofits are not a market for doing good; they’re a market for warm fuzzies”. This is used as justification for why it’s possible to do immense amounts of good by donating. However, while it’s certainly true that most donors aren’t explicitly trying to purchase utililty, there’s still a lot of money that is.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Gates Foundation</a> is an example of such an organization. They’re effectiveness-minded and with $60 billion behind them. 80,000 Hours has already <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/239-show-me-the-harm\">noted</a> that they’ve probably saved over 6 million lives with their vaccine programs alone—given that they’ve spent a relatively small part of their endowment, they must be getting a much better exchange rate than our current best guesses.</p><p>So why not just donate to the Gates Foundation? Effective altruists need a better account of the “market inefficiencies” that they’re exploiting that Gates isn’t. Why didn’t the Gates Foundation fund the <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, GiveWell’s top charity, when it’s in one of their main research areas? It seems implausible that the answer is simple incompetence or the like.</p><p>A general rule of markets is that if you don’t know what your edge is, you’re the sucker. Many effective altruists, when asked what their edge is, give some answer along the lines of “actually being strategic/thinking about utility/caring about results”, and stop thinking there. This isn’t a compelling case: as mentioned before, it’s not clear why no one else is doing these things.</p><h2>Inconsistent attitude towards rigor</h2><p>Effective altruists insist on extraordinary rigor in their charity recommendations—cf. for instance GiveWell’s work. Yet for many ancillary problems—donating now vs. later, choosing a career, and deciding how “meta” to go (between direct work, earning to give, doing advocacy, and donating to advocacy), to name a few—they seem happy to choose between the not-obviously-wrong alternatives based on intuition and gut feelings.</p><h2>Poor psychological understanding</h2><p>John Sturm suggests, and I agree, that many of these issues are psychological in nature:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I think a lot of these problems take root a commitment level issue:</p><p>I, for instance, am thrilled about changing my mentality towards charity, not my mentality towards having kids. My first guess is that - from an EA and overall ethical perspective - it would be a big mistake for me to have kids (even after taking into account the normal EA excuses about doing things for myself). At least right now, though, I just don’t care that I’m ignoring my ethics and EA; I want to have kids and that’s that.</p><p>This is a case in which I’m not “being lazy” so much as just not trying at all. But when someone asks me about it, it’s easier for me to give some EA excuse (like that having kids will make me happier and more productive) that I don’t think is true - and then I look like I’m being a lazy or careless altruist rather than not being one at all.</p><p>The model I’m building is this: there are many different areas in life where I could apply EA. In some of them, I’m wholeheartedly willing. In some of them, I’m not willing at all. Then there are two kinds of areas where it looks like I’m being a lazy EA: those where I’m willing and want to be a better EA… and those where I’m not willing but I’m just pretending (to myself or others or both).</p><p>The point of this: when we ask someone to be a less lazy EA, we are (1) helping them do a better job at something they want to do, and (2) trying to make them either do more than they want to or admit they are “bad”.</p></blockquote><p>In general, most effective altruists respond to deep conflicts between effective altruism and other goals in one of the following ways:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Unconsciously resolve the cognitive dissonance with motivated reasoning: “it’s clearly my comparative advantage to spread effective altruism through poetry!”</li><li>Deliberately and knowingly use motivated reasoning: “dear Facebook group, what are the best utilitarian arguments in favor of becoming an EA poet?”</li><li>Take the easiest “honest” way out: “I wouldn’t be psychologically able to do effective altruism if it forced me to go into finance instead of writing poetry, so I’ll become an effective altruist poet instead”.</li></ol><p>The third is debatably defensible—though, for a community that purports to put stock in rationality and self-improvement, effective altruists have shown surprisingly little interest in self-modification to have more altruistic intentions. This seems obviously worthy of further work.</p><p>Furthermore, EA norms do not proscribe even the first two, leading to a group norm that doesn’t cause people to notice when they’re engaging in a certain amount of motivated cognition. This is quite toxic to the movement’s ability to converge on the truth. (As before, effective altruists are still better than the general population at this; the core EA principles are strong enough to make people notice the most obvious motivated cognition that obviously runs afoul of them. But that’s not nearly good enough.)</p><h2>Historical analogues</h2><p>With the partial exception of GiveWell’s <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/history-of-philanthropy\">history of philanthropy project</a>, there’s been no research into good historical outside views. Although there are no direct precursors of effective altruism (worrying in its own right; see above), there is one notably similar movement: communism, where the idea of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” originated. Communism is also notable for its various abject failures. Effective altruists need to be more worried about how they will avoid failures of a similar class—and in general they need to be more aware of the pitfalls, as well as the benefits, of being an increasingly large social movement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron Tucker elaborates better than I could:</p><blockquote><p>In particular, Communism/Socialism was a movement that was started by philosophers, then continued by technocrats, where they thought reason and planning could make the world much better, and that if they coordinated to take action to fix everything, they could eliminate poverty, disease, etc.</p><p>Marx totally got the “actually trying vs. pretending to try” distinction AFAICT (“Philosophers have only explained the world, but the real problem is to change it” is a quote of his), and he really strongly rails against people who unreflectively try to fix things in ways that make sense to the culture they’re starting from—the problem isn’t that the bourgeoisie aren’t trying to help people, it’s that the only conception of help that the bourgeoisie have is one that’s mostly epiphenomenal to actually improving the lives of the proletariat—giving them nice boureoisie things like education and voting rights, but not doing anything to improve the material condition of their life, or fix the problems of why they don’t have those in the first place, and don’t just make them themselves.</p><p>So if Marx got the pretend/actually try distinction, and his followers took over countries, and they had a ton of awesome technocrats, it seems like it’s the perfect EA thing, and it totally didn’t work.</p></blockquote><h2>Monoculture</h2><p>Effective altruists are not very diverse. The vast majority are white, “upper-middle-class”, intellectually and philosophically inclined, from a developed country, etc. (and I think it skews significantly male as well, though I’m less sure of this). And as much as the multiple-perspectives argument for diversity is hackneyed by this point, it seems quite germane, especially when considering e.g. global health interventions, whose beneficiaries are culturally very foreign to us.</p><p>Effective altruists are not very humanistically aware either. EA came out of analytic philosophy and spread from there to math and computer science. As such, they are too hasty to dismiss many arguments as moral-relativist postmodernist fluff, e.g. that effective altruists are promoting cultural imperialism by forcing a Westernized conception of “the good” onto people they’re trying to help. Even if EAs are quite confident that the utilitarian/reductionist/rationalist worldview is correct, the outside view is that really engaging with a greater diversity of opinions is very helpful.</p><h2>Community problems</h2><p>The discourse around effective altruism in e.g. the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Facebook group</a> used to be of fairly high quality. But as the movement grows, the traditional venues of discussion are getting inundated with new people who haven’t absorbed the norms of discussion or standards of proof yet. If this is not rectified quickly, the EA community will cease to be useful at all: there will be no venue in which a group truth-seeking process can operate. Yet nobody seems to be aware of the magnitude of this problem. There have been some half-hearted attempts to fix it, but nothing much has come of them.</p><h2>Movement building issues</h2><p>The whole point of having an effective altruism “movement” is that it’ll be bigger than the sum of its parts. Being organized as a movement should turn effective altruism into the kind of large, semi-monolithic actor that can actually get big stuff done, not just make marginal contributions.</p><p>But in practice, large movements and truth-seeking hardly ever go together. As movements grow, they get more “epistemic inertia”: it becomes much harder for them to update on evidence. This is because they have to rely on social methods to propagate their memes rather than truth-seeking behavior. But people who have been drawn to EA by social pressure rather than truth-seeking take much longer to change their beliefs, so once the movement reaches a critical mass of them, it will become difficult for it to update on new evidence. As described above, this is already happening to effective altruism with the ever-less-useful Facebook group.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I’ve presented several areas in which the effective altruism movement fails to converge on truth through a combination of the following effects:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Effective altruists “stop thinking” too early and satisfice for “doesn’t obviously conflict with EA principles” rather than optimizing for “increases utility”. (For instance, they choose donations poorly due to this effect.)</li><li>Effective altruism puts strong demands on its practitioners, and EA group norms do not appropriately guard against motivated cognition to avoid them. (For example, this often causes people to choose bad careers.)</li><li>Effective altruists don’t notice important areas to look into, specifically issues related to “being a successful movement” rather than “correctly implementing utilitarianism”. (For instance, they ignore issues around group epistemology, historical precedents for the movement, movement diversity, etc.)</li></ol><p>These problems are worrying on their own, but the lack of awareness of them is the real problem. The monoculture is worrying, but the lackadaisical attitude towards it is worse. The lack of rigor is unfortunate, but the fact that people haven’t noticed it is the real problem.</p><p>Either effective altruists don’t yet realize that they’re subject to the failure modes of any large movement, or they don’t feel motivation to do the boring legwork of e.g. engaging with viewpoints that your inside view says are annoying but that the outside view says are useful on expectation. Either way, this bespeaks worrying things about the movement’s staying power.</p><p>More importantly, it also indicates an epistemic failure on the part of effective altruists. The fact that no one else within EA has done a substantial critique yet is a huge red flag. If effective altruists aren’t aware of strong critiques of the EA movement, why aren’t they looking for them? This suggests that, contrary to the emphasis on rationality within the movement, many effective altruists’ beliefs are based on social, rather than truth-seeking, behavior.</p><p>If it doesn’t solve these problems, effective-altruism-the-movement won’t help me achieve any more good than I could individually. All it will do is add epistemic inertia, as it takes more effort to shift the EA consensus than to update my individual beliefs.</p><h2>Are these problems solvable?</h2><p>It seems to me that the third issue above (lack of self-awareness as a social movement) subsumes the other two: if effective altruism as a movement were sufficiently introspective, it could probably notice and solve the other two problems, as well as future ones that will undoubtedly crop up.</p><p>Hence, I propose an additional principle of effective altruism. In addition to being <i>altruistic</i>, <i>maximizing</i>, <i>egalitarian</i>, and <i>consequentialist</i> we should be <i>self-aware</i>: we should think carefully about the issues associated with being a successful movement, in order to make sure that we can move beyond the obvious applications of EA principles and come up with non-trivially better ways to improve the world.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/\">Nick Bostrom</a> for coining the idea of a hypothetical apostasy, and to <a href=\"http://becomingeden.com/\">Will Eden</a> for <a href=\"http://becomingeden.com/hypothetical-apostasy-on-nutrition/\">mentioning</a> it recently.</p><p>Thanks to Michael Vassar, <a href=\"http://philogenic.wordpress.com/\">Aaron Tucker</a> and Andrew Rettek for inspiring various of these points.</p><p>Thanks to Aaron Tucker and John Sturm for reading an advance draft of this post and giving valuable feedback.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"sSZ8pCvackwaY9vBx":12},"voteCount":11,"baseScore":24,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000184,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:35:22.911Z","name":"Criticism of effective altruism","slug":"criticism-of-effective-altruism","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Criticism of effective altruism</strong> collects critical discussion of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/effective-altruism\">effective altruism</a> ideas (as opposed to criticism of effective altruist <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-organizations\">organizations </a>or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-causes\">causes</a>, or the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-the-effective-altruism-community\">effective altruism community</a>).</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Kuhn, Ben (2013) <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique/\">A critique of effective altruism</a>, <i>Ben Kuhn’s Blog</i>, December 2.</p><p>McMahan, Jeff (2016) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5840/tpm20167379\">Philosophical critiques of effective altruism</a>, <i>The Philosophers’ Magazine</i>, vol. 73, pp. 92–99.</p><p>Nielsen, Michael (2022) <a href=\"https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/\">Notes on effective altruism</a>, <i>Michael’s Notebook</i>, June 2.</p><p>Rowe, Abraham (2022) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/n3WwTz4dbktYwNQ2j/critiques-of-ea-that-i-want-to-read\">Critiques of EA that I want to read</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>, June 19.</p><p>Wiblin, Robert &amp; Keiran Harris (2019) <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/vitalik-buterin-new-ways-to-fund-public-goods/\">Vitalik Buterin on effective altruism, better ways to fund public goods, the blockchain’s problems so far, and how it could yet change the world</a>, <i>80,000 Hours</i>, September 3.</p><p>Zhang, Linchuan (2021) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pxALB46SEkwNbfiNS/the-motivated-reasoning-critique-of-effective-altruism\">The motivated reasoning critique of effective altruism</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>, September 14.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-causes\">criticism of effective altruist causes</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-organizations\">criticism of effective altruist organizations</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-the-effective-altruism-community\">criticism of the effective altruism community</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/criticism-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk-studies\">criticism of longtermism and existential risk studies</a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism\">effective altruism</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/red-teaming\">red teaming</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/scalably-using-labour\">scalably using labour</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/social-and-intellectual-movements\">social and intellectual movements</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/working-at-ea-vs-non-ea-orgs\">working at EA vs non-EA orgs</a></p>","postCount":189,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"sSZ8pCvackwaY9vBx"}]},{"_id":"YujtHBxk7L6o6YPaP","postedAt":"2013-12-10T19:16:42.000Z","modifiedAt":null,"title":"What's the best domestic charity?","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2013-12-19T15:28:00.000Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YujtHBxk7L6o6YPaP/what-s-the-best-domestic-charity","htmlBody":"<html><body><p>Here&apos;s a very tentative thought: A lot of people respond to effective altruism by saying that they want to give to charities that work on their home country. Insofar as effective altruists (typically, roughly speaking) care about everyone equally, they obviously care about the welfare of Americans (Brits, Australians, Canadians, etc). It&apos;s just that, because of diminishing returns, the best opportunities for helping people are very likely to be abroad. However, it wouldn&apos;t be <em>that</em> surprising to me if there were very good giving opportunities domestically. &#xA0;All it would take is for some very cheap but very effective activity to have been relatively overlooked in the domestic charity sector, or for some domestic charitable activity to have high positive externalities or large positive flow-on effects.</p><p>So it&apos;s at least somewhat plausible to me that the best response to &quot;charity begins at home&quot; is &quot;ok, if that&apos;s what you value you should give to [insert good domestic charity].&quot; That response would:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>Show people that we&apos;re supportive of all attempts to do good, even if there are value-disagreements (a lot of recent criticism comes down to &quot;how dare you be so moralistic and condemn such-and-such cause as unworthy&quot; which isn&apos;t what we&apos;re trying to say at all).</li>\n\t<li>Make for an easier entry into a conversation about values, and to then discuss why people choose to support domestic charities over international ones. It would show we&apos;re on the same side - maximising impact - and are just differing in our implementation of that general maxim. (Obviously, many people might just be trying to come up with excuses for not giving effectively in general. But then giving domestic recommendations would test whether that&apos;s the case or not.)</li>\n\t<li>Potentially get a much wider demographic of people interested in effective altruism.</li>\n\t<li>Potentially - if we actually can find great domestic charities (including, perhaps, ones with positive international externalities) - move poorly spent charitable giving to more effective causes.</li>\n</ol>\nI know that GiveWell used to recommend domestic charities, and I disagreed with them then for doing so. I would still disagree with them if they were to recommend Nurse-Family Partnership or KIPP Houston, as I doubt that these have the requisite level of good done per dollar to be worth promoting.<p></p><p>But others might do better. [Edit: After comments suggesting that these &apos;illustrations&apos; are low-quality enough to be actively misleading, I take back the following]. <del>Off the top of my head, these might be contenders:</del>\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><del>Promoting mindfulness meditation. Reason: Depression is set to soon become the largest contributor to the global burden of disease. Mindfulness meditation seems to have a good evidence base behind it, for reducing rates of depression, anxiety and general stress. It consists mainly of breathing exercises, and could be taught through mass media, which could give it a very low cost per person treated. As well as the benefits to the people treated, it could have significant positive flow-on effects: (i) <a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/does_mindfulness_make_you_compassionate\">it has been suggested</a> that mindfulness meditation boosts leads to increased levels <a href=\"http://compassion.stanford.edu/programs/researchProjects.html\">of</a> <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12671-012-0115-4\">altruism</a>; [NB: I haven&apos;t vetted these claims at all] (ii) it would increase productivity of those in the US, and general economic growth is good, including for poorer countries through the increased value of trade; (iii) if successful it could be rolled out to developing countries as well.</del></li>\n\t<li><del>Paying to support the better political party, such as through Get Out the Vote.

If the party with better domestic policies also has better international policies, then this would have significant benefits for the developing world.</del></li>\n</ul>\nThese aren&apos;t meant to be actual suggestions, just illustrations of how this could work.

If you&apos;d like to do the same, e-mail me at the usual address or facebook me. This first post is from Eric Friedman, author of Reinventing Philanthropy and long-time GiveWell supporter. -- William MacAskill</em></p><p>When deciding where to give, my starting point is GiveWell&#x2019;s recommendations.&#xA0; In past years, a majority of my giving has followed GiveWell&#x2019;s recommendations, but that will be less so this year because of emerging concerns that I have with GiveWell&#x2019;s approach.&#xA0; I believe GiveWell&#x2019;s standard of evidence for impact is too high&#x2014;so high that it is passing over charities that are likely to be higher impact than its recommended charities. <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/process\">GiveWell&#x2019;s website </a> describes its process as trying to identify opportunities for which they &#x201C;could draw a maximally confident, linear, quantified link between donations and outcomes, along the lines of &#x2018;$X per life saved&#x2019;&#x201D;.&#xA0; That is, they are heavily concerned about minimizing the risk of failure.&#xA0; My preferred criteria would allow more risk-taking in order to have the potential to do more good.&#xA0; GiveWell has acknowledged that accepting more risk is likely to open the doors to higher-impact giving opportunities; that is a significant motivation for GiveWell Labs, though there are yet to be any recommendations from GiveWell Labs.</p><p>The four charities I will give to are the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), Evidence Action (the parent organization of Deworm the World), UNICEF, and GiveWell.&#xA0; The remainder of this post details why I&#x2019;m giving to each of the organizations I give to as well as why I am not funding GiveDirectly.</p><p>AMF was GiveWell&#x2019;s favorite charity last year.&#xA0; My understanding is that GiveWell removed AMF from its recommendations largely because of a small, though non-trivial probability of not being able to utilize its cash reserves for a mosquito net distribution.&#xA0; Because of how strongly GiveWell has favored AMF in the past, giving to AMF seems likely to have significantly greater impact than SCI and GiveDirectly, but with a slightly larger probability of failure.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m willing to accept that (as is <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-12-12/why-we-continue-to-recommend-the-against-malaria-foundation\">Giving What We Can</a>).</p><p>Evidence Action is the parent organization for Deworm the World and Dispensers for Safe Water; only the first of those two is recommended by GiveWell.&#xA0; Evidence Action is an off-shoot of Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), which specializes in doing randomized controlled trials to discover what works to help the world&#x2019;s poor.&#xA0; IPA does much of the research that GiveWell relies on&#x2014;even being involved with the research on GiveDirectly.&#xA0; IPA are experts in developmental research and test numerous programs, so I assign a lot of credibility to their putting Dispensers for Safe Water out for expansion.</p><p>GiveWell seemed less excited about the evidence for <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality\">Dispensers for Safe Water</a>, questioning the robustness of the studies evaluating it.&#xA0; That&#x2019;s a reasonable view, but I&#x2019;m excited about the possibility of expanding the intervention <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/from_proof_to_impact\">as a way to get more evidence</a>.&#xA0; It might be the next big proven solution, and I view it as a high priority to find out.&#xA0; Evidence Action&#x2019;s management team is clearly excited about testing and proving programs, as demonstrated by their affiliation with Innovations for Poverty Action, GiveWell&#x2019;s observations about their Deworm the World Program, and some of their own statements.&#xA0; So I plan to donate to Evidence Action, unrestricted, and allow them to use the funds for either of their programs&#x2014;wherever they think it is needed most.</p><p>UNICEF is different from GiveWell&#x2019;s recommended charities, which almost always focus on only a single intervention.&#xA0; GiveWell has expressed several concerns with mega-charities such as <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/28/mega-charities/\">UNICEF</a>, most notably that &#x201C;they engage in a wide variety of activities, and we can&#x2019;t get a concrete sense of (a) the specifics of the activities; (b) the organization-wide track record; (c) likely uses of additional funding.&#x201D;&#xA0; I share that concern.&#xA0; In UNICEF&#x2019;s case, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/parmo/files/RR_REPORT_2012_NY_FINAL_DOUBLEPAGE.pdf\">68% of their 2012 revenue was restricted</a>, so it is not possible to look at their current activities and understand what they view as priorities or what they would do with additional unrestricted gifts.&#xA0; However, UNICEF has advantages over organizations that focus on a single program, and these should not be ignored.&#xA0; For example, there is value to having a lot of experience working in the developing world and having permanent in-country staff.&#xA0; Ironically, this value can be seen through AMF&#x2019;s weaknesses; GiveWell removed AMF from its recommendations because of AMF&#x2019;s inability to finalize a large net distribution, which GiveWell attributes to a communication style that put off potential partners and a lack of in-person communication.&#xA0; UNICEF is much less likely to have that type of problem.</p><p>In addition, UNICEF is a key implementer of several of the proven cost-effective interventions that GiveWell has had difficulty finding <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/\">room for more funding </a>for, including being the world&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/parmo/66662_66850.html\">largest purchaser of vaccines</a>.&#xA0; UNICEF&#x2019;s track record includes a number of programs that likely have higher impact than GiveWell&#x2019;s top recommendations.&#xA0; I view that as a sign about UNICEF&#x2019;s values and capabilities.&#xA0; If GiveWell is right about their room for more finding, my donation to UNICEF may not directly increase the scale of these programs.&#xA0; However, I believe there is significant value to giving them unrestricted support, which might be used to maintain their capabilities or expand other programs they view as priorities.&#xA0; Nevertheless, some of UNICEF&#x2019;s programs are not in areas I view as priorities; I don&#x2019;t know to what extent that is because of restricted grants versus UNICEF&#x2019;s decisions.&#xA0; I wish I had more visibility into this, but that&#x2019;s a risk I&#x2019;m willing to take.</p><p>GiveDirectly is absent from the list of charities I&#x2019;m donating to, though it is the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/03/good-ventures-matching-gift-to-givedirectly-and-grants-to-top-charities/\">favored charity of Good Ventures</a> as well as most of <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">GiveWell&#x2019;s staff</a>.&#xA0; <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">GiveWell describes GiveDirectly&#x2019;s </a>intervention as having &#x201C;an unusually low burden of proof.&#x201D;&#xA0; Even GiveWell seems to state that GiveDirectly is probably less cost-effective than its other recommended charities.&#xA0; <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/\">The suggested upside of GiveDirectly</a> is that it will &#x201C;improve the aid community&#x2019;s understanding of, and interest in, cash transfer programs.&#x201D; This seems to be a preference for strong evidence of impact over evidence of strong impact.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m more excited about discovering, testing and promoting interventions with evidence of stronger impact.</p><p>After writing all that, it may be surprising that I&#x2019;m still going to donate to GiveWell.&#xA0; I still believe they have a very strong team and are an extremely important resource for the giving community.&#xA0; Even when I don&#x2019;t take their recommendations, the knowledge I gained from them has improved my giving.&#xA0; GiveWell Labs will loosen the requirements for evidence, which I look forward to.&#xA0; I also hope GiveWell will adjust its criteria for traditional charity recommendations to better balance the desires for high impact and robust evidence.&#xA0;

Furthermore, it&#x2019;s a core conviction of mine that living an ethical and fulfilling life requires donating as much as one can spare to the best causes.</p>\n<p>But what are those best causes? The only honest answer is that I don&#x2019;t know. I think I have a good grasp of where the best causes <em>aren&#x2019;t</em>, but a lot more research has to be done by myself and others before I can feel confident giving anywhere. Therefore, I&#x2019;ve decided to donate very minimally and save my donations for later.</p>\n<h2>My plan to learn through giving</h2>\n<p>If anything is the core foundation of effective altruism theory, it&#x2019;s that causes can differ from each other in expected impact by <em>tremendous</em> amounts. The example of spending <a href=\"http://www.guidedogsofamerica.org/1/\">$42K on a guide dog</a> in the developed world versus spending <a href=\"http://www.hollows.org.au/\">$25 to cure blindness in the developing world</a> is very salient comparison to me, though <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2008/07/21/preventing-blindness/\">perhaps it is not completely fair</a>. There&#x2019;s also a concern echoed by Brian Tomasik that since we&#x2019;re uncertain about a lot of cause-and-effect relationships, <a href=\"http://utilitarian-essays.com/robustness-against-uncertainty.html\">what appears to be doing good might actually be a harm!</a> I therefore want to be pretty careful with how I donate even $1K, because that could be worth the same as millions of dollars elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This makes it a huge priority to learn more about opportunities for doing good, whether by donating or working. Thus, I&#x2019;ve decided to spend my money and time trying to figure out how to learn more in reliable ways and I&#x2019;m going to be slow to disperse money until I find ways I can reliably <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/10/obstacles-to-giving-as-consumption/\">invest that money</a> in learning. You can see the money I donate, as I donate it, on <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/donations.html\">my donations page</a>.</p>\n<h3>What is my plan, more specifically?</h3>\n<p>My current plan is to keep a line in my budget spreadsheet that specifies how much donations I &#x201C;owe&#x201D;, which currently will be 20% of my total income. Currently, I don&#x2019;t have any plans to earmark these donations in any other way, and they will just remain a part of my total investments.</p>\n<h2>What about other opportunities?</h2>\n<h3>Why not a donor-advised fund?</h3>\n<p>If I keep up the plan of saving long-term, I will eventually get a donor advised fund for tax reasons. However, right now I am still a college student and I am not yet in a position where I need to worry about taxes. I&#x2019;m also not worried, at least in the short-term, about the traditional concern of values drift that a donor advised fund protects against.</p>\n<p>I also think there are two compelling advantages to keeping some donatable money outside of a donor-advised fund: (a) keeping the ability to move money to projects that do not have 501(c)3 status (something I expect to run into a lot, actually) and (b) keeping the ability to save money for myself, in case I want to <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/\">retire early</a> and work full-time on EA stuff.</p>\n<h3>What about GiveWell?</h3>\n<p>I have high trust and broad epistemic and methodological agreement with GiveWell. I normally look to GiveWell&#x2019;s recommendations as solid opportunities for doing good. However, this year, the recommendations available seem to be poorer than usual. As <a href=\"http://www.reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/off-cuff-thoughts-on-givewells-2013.html\">Carl Shulman points out</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">GiveWell employees confirm</a>, this favors saving to wait for later.</p>\n<p>However, I still find GiveDirectly to be intuitively appealing and I&#x2019;m attracted to the relative simplicity of the model and using GiveDirectly as a way of spreading cost-effectiveness. Therefore, while I haven&#x2019;t personally put any money toward GiveDirectly, I&#x2019;ve <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-id-like-for-my-birthday-and-christmas/\">asked for donations to GiveDirectly for my birthday and Christmas</a>.</p>\n<h3>What about GiveWell Labs?</h3>\n<p>I thus have strongly considered donating to GiveWell directly to help them, and have done so in the past. However, as of <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/28/givewell-and-good-ventures/\">their recent partnership with Good Ventures</a>, I believe them to now have all the funds they need to operate. GiveWell wishes to have <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/20/update-on-givewells-funding-needs/\">additional donations for diversification purposes</a>, so as to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/09/17/balancing-support-from-good-ventures-vs-individuals/\">maintain their independence from Good Ventures</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I personally don&#x2019;t find this to be a compelling and urgent need. If the situation were that Good Ventures were withdrawing and GiveWell was going to scale back significantly, I would probably donate (depending on the reason for Good Ventures) splitting. But right now, I think there are more urgent needs and therefore I consider GiveWell to have no &#x201C;room for more funding&#x201D;. I intend to write more about this.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one can think of moving money to GiveWell Labs <a href=\"http://www.reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/donor-advised-fund-using-future.html\">as a donation to Good Ventures&#x2019;s future funding</a>, increasing the amount of money that is moved to future recommendations by GiveWell. This could be compelling given my broad trust about GiveWell, but right now I think it&#x2019;s generally more robust to wait and see what other opportunities I find, since (a) there&#x2019;s a risk that I might stop trusting Good Ventures / GiveWell, (b) I might run into a better funding opportunity that Good Ventures / GiveWell is not in a position to also fund, and (c) I don&#x2019;t yet get tax benefits on moving donations out of my investment account.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other groups working on EA learning that you like?</h3>\n<p>I&#x2019;m also watching closely the work of other organizations, like the <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> (CEA), the <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI), the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a> (FHI), <a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org\">Effective Animal Activism</a> (EAA), and Brian Tomasik&#x2019;s upcoming Foundational Research Institute (FRI). All of these organizations seem focused on learning in potentially useful ways and I could see myself moving significant amounts of money to them.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I do not yet have enough detail on what these organizations are doing to learn and whether they are following methodologies for learning I would endorse and therefore I&#x2019;m not quite confident enough to give large sums of money to these organizations. Spending more time figuring out what these organizations are doing and spending more time figuring out what methodologies for learning I would endorse are top priorities for me going forward. Some aspects I&#x2019;m concerned about is whether good monitoring and evaluation procedures are in place to make sure progress is made. It&#x2019;s very easy to do things and not learn about them and end up spinning in circles, especially with theoretical work.</p>\n<p>But I&#x2019;m excited about 80,000 Hours&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013\">recent impact report</a>, Giving What We Can&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjEyNmI1Y2ZhMmUwYjk2ODk\">plan to focus on monitoring and evaluation for their pledgees</a>, and <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2013/04/13/miris-strategy-for-2013/\">MIRI&#x2019;s commitment</a> to <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2013/04/04/the-lean-nonprofit/\">&#x201C;lean non-profit&#x201D; methodologies</a>. I look forward to following more development in these areas and I plan on writing more about this.</p>\n<p>I also intend to spend a substantial amount of time looking for projects that I myself can take on to both perform and fund necessary expenses out of my donation account. I&#x2019;ve created an organization with Ozzie Gooen, <a href=\"http://www.dotimpact.im\">.impact</a>, that will allow us to both do this. I&#x2019;m not yet sure if .impact will produce more promising opportunities in research or other areas than these other organizations, but I look forward to further exploration to see what I can find. .impact has not fully launched yet, and I expect to write a lot more about it later.</p>\n<p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-im-giving-and-why/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"BAbo53eWZFH4cFjkR":8},"voteCount":4,"baseScore":5,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000086,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T20:02:53.852Z","name":"Donation writeup","slug":"donation-writeup","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>In a <strong>donation writeup</strong>, someone explains why they've chosen to donate or grant money to a particular recipient, or why they've recommended that other people donate.

I tend to spread donations out throughout the year, so I don&apos;t feel a particular rush in December. But, since the end of the tax year is a lot of people&apos;s giving season, I want to share my thoughts.</p><p>My previous favorite, the Against Malaria Foundation, is <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">not looking so good</a> lately due to problems distributing their mosquito nets. I&apos;m not super concerned about this &#x2013; I think it&apos;s likely that they&apos;ll get their act together in the next six months or so and resume distributing nets. But I don&apos;t plan to donate to them until that happens. (This is the kind of thing I&apos;m really glad GiveWell is here to tell me about &#x2013; as a donor, I would never have picked up on the problem.)</p><p>My parents usually make a donation as a Christmas present to me, and they asked where they should make it. &#xA0;I asked them to give to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">Give Directly</a>. &#xA0;I think the just-give-cash method makes a lot of sense, given the evidence that recipients choose quite well what they need, and I hope this idea will catch on. &#xA0;The organization itself seems quite transparent and sensibly run. &#xA0;I also found it encouraging that so many GiveWell staff are making <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">their personal donations</a> there.</p><p>I can see advantages to donating later, especially given the fact that the Against Malaria Foundation (which looked like the strongest contender for a good while) may catch up again soon. &#xA0;So I&apos;ll probably hold most of my donations for about six months and see how things look then.</p><p>If I were holding off longer, like years, I would probably put my donations in a donor-advised fund like <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/donate/donor-advised-fund\">GiveWell&apos;s</a> or&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-10-29/the-giving-what-we-can-trust\">Giving What We Can&apos;s</a>.</p><p>I also plan to donate some to organizations like GiveWell, Giving What We Can, or 80,000 Hours (I haven&apos;t decided on the breakdown yet). &#xA0;I think this is an important time both for exposing more people to the idea of effective altruism and for developing better knowledge about where to give. &#xA0;I need to look more specifically into what those organizations would do with more funding.</p><p>Lastly, I&apos;ll make some feel-good donations to causes that aren&apos;t the most effective (a fundraiser for a friend&apos;s business, my Quaker meeting, etc.) These donations come out of my personal spending budget, not my charity budget.</p><p>One obvious question is: why divide up money rather than giving all to one place? Giving What We Can makes some good points in their <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-11-20/should-you-only-donate-to-one-charity\">recent post</a> about why to donate all to one charity. &#xA0;But I&apos;m also persuaded that we should act how we want other people to act, and I wouldn&apos;t want the whole effective altruist community to donate to only one place. &#xA0;So I&apos;m okay with dividing things up a bit.</p><p><em>Cross-posted from <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Giving Gladly</a></em></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"BAbo53eWZFH4cFjkR":8},"voteCount":2,"baseScore":3,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000088,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T20:02:53.852Z","name":"Donation writeup","slug":"donation-writeup","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>In a <strong>donation writeup</strong>, someone explains why they've chosen to donate or grant money to a particular recipient, or why they've recommended that other people donate.

I donated to AMF, SCI, Deworm the World, Project Healthy Children, and the Copenhagen Consensus Center because I want to demonstrate my support for extremely cost-effective first-order charities. But I think that the highest-expected-value donation opportunities are to &apos;meta&apos; organisations. I think that the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA), Centre for the Study of Existential Risks (CSER), and setting up an Effective Altruism Fund are the three big contenders for best expected bang per buck. Even after trying to correct for obvious personal bias, I think that CEA wins out for my comparatively small donation; if I had info that the relevant position at CSER wouldn&apos;t be funded anyway, and if I had more to give (e.g. ~$70k) then I think that CSER would be better.</p><p></p><h3>0. Introduction</h3><p></p><p>I divided my donations into two classes.</p><p>First, because my donations partly represent the Centre for Effective Altruism as a whole, I use about half of my donations as a way of demonstrating my support for highly cost-effective organisations that lie outside the core effective altruism community. This year I donated to AMF, SCI, Deworm the World, Project Healthy Children, and the Copenhagen Consensus Center. (Because these have the purpose of showing my support, the <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-11-20/should-you-only-donate-to-one-charity\">usual arguments</a> in favour of giving to just one charity don&#x2019;t apply). These were all recommended by GWWC except the Copenhagen Consensus Center &#x2013; I chose to donate to them because I think that promoting global prioritisation is one of the most important activities to be doing, and, though harder to be sure about, their influence is potentially measured in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. (My main worry with them is that Lomborg&#x2019;s (inaccurate) reputation as a climate skeptic might taint the idea of global prioritisation.) I didn&#x2019;t donate to GiveDirectly because I don&#x2019;t find GiveWell&#x2019;s arguments for their &#x2018;upside&#x2019; potential to be compelling as a reason to donate on the margin. (Some discussion <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-11-30/givewell%E2%80%99s-recommendation-of-givedirectly\">here</a>, though this post is now a year old).</p><p>The second half of my donations I used in whatever way I believe will maximise expected impact, given my particular values and knowledge. I think there are three main contenders.\n</p><h3>1. Donating unrestricted to the Centre for Effective Altruism</h3>\nI think that building the effective altruism movement is in general the highest-value near term activity, for two reasons:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Leverage. $1 donated to movement-building generates significantly more than $1&#x2019;s worth of money and time for the highest-value causes. My view is that this rate of return is far beyond what one could get through financial investment. I&#x2019;ve written about this before <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/fej/giving_what_we_can_80000_hours_and_metacharity/\">here</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Keeping options open. Effective altruists&#x2019; donations and use of time are sensitive to the best evidence. I expect our evidence about the best uses of time and money to get much better over the next few years.&#xA0; This would motivate saving and giving later &#xA0;(see <a href=\"/ea/4e/giving_now_vs_later_a_summary/\">here</a> for more arguments on either side) &#x2013; but donating to movement-building is a way of doing that, except with a higher rate of return.</li>\n</ol>\nThe best precise donation opportunity in this area, in my view, is to CEA, unrestricted such that it can be spent on projects other than Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours. There are a number of new projects that are plausibly even higher-impact, on the margin, than GWWC/80k, but which don&#x2019;t have a track record, and so are comparatively difficult to fundraise for. For example, we&#x2019;ve recently been involved in a number of meetings with people in the UK government, and we wish to develop ideas from CEA and FHI into policy-relevant documents. We are hiring an Oxford academic to help with this (among other things).<p></p><p>CEA unrestricted is where I ultimately chose to give. There is obviously a great risk of bias: it seems to me to be an awful coincidence if I think that the organisation I cofounded is the most cost-effective use of money on the margin. But, even after trying to correct for these biases, CEA remained my top choice. (A partial response to the &#x2018;coincidence&#x2019; worry is that a <i>very</i> small number of organisations have ever been started with the aim of maximising the good they do, where the founders&#x2019; view of &#x2018;maximising the good&#x2019; is the same as or similar to mine (i.e. understood in effective altruist terms).)\n</p><h3>2. Donating to the Centre for the Study of Existential Risks</h3>\nFrom what I know, this seems like an opportunity for great leverage. Marginal donations will be used to fund program management and grantwriting, which would turn ~$70k into a significant chance of ~$1-$10mn, and launch what I think might become one of the most important research institutions in the world. They have high profile people on the board, Cambridge affiliation, and an already written previous grant proposal that very narrowly missed out on being successful (for ~$10mn). It seems to me that they just need a bit of start-up money in order to hire someone to apply for major grants.<p></p><p>I&#x2019;ve only been thinking of them as a donation opportunity recently, and would need to know more about CSER&#x2019;s funding situation before being confident in the above views. For example, if Jaan Tallinn is already paying for a program manager or grant writer, then this leverage opportunity might already have been taken. This expenditure is also pretty lumpy, and I don&apos;t expect them to get all their donations from small individual donations, so it seems to me that donating 1/50th of the cost of a program manager isn&apos;t as good as 1/50th of the value of a program manager. For those with a larger amount to give, the situation is different.\n</p><h3>3. Setting up an Effective Altruism Fund</h3>\nThe idea behind this is that it&#x2019;s meant to be strictly better than saving and donating later. The idea is that people who are saving in order to donate later tell some central body &#x2013; the EA fund &#x2013; how much they&#x2019;re saving. The EA fund can then advertise the fact that it has some significant amount of money that&#x2019;s waiting for a high-impact enough opportunity. This could have the following benefits:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Incentivises new effective altruism start-ups, which could get seed funding from it (e.g. Effective Fundraising needed just a few thousand dollars &#x2013; a use of money that I think was clearly worth it).</li>\n\t<li>Can be used as loans e.g. for people who want to pursue earning to give but need to retrain.</li>\n\t<li>Can be used as &#x2018;emergency reserves&#x2019; for several organisations. (Insofar as risks of running out of funding should be only partially correlated between different EA organisations, it makes sense for there to be a shared pool of funding, rather than each organisation having their own reserves.&#xA0; This means you need a lower total amount of reserves than if every organisation had their own).</li>\n\t<li>Can be used as insurance for individuals. Insofar as individuals will be more risk-averse with respect to money when thinking about their own self-interest than when thinking altruistically, we should expect people to be biased in the direction of playing it safe in their career choices. This could be a way of encouraging people to take more risks &#x2013; by giving them a safety net if things turn out badly.&#xA0; &#xA0;(Note: though this makes sense in theory, I haven&#x2019;t seen examples of it in practice, perhaps because there are few paths that result in total failure if they don&#x2019;t work out. It might apply for someone, for example, thinking about entrepreneurship versus consultancy and worried by the failure rate of new start-ups.)</li>\n</ol>\nMy view is that this is better than saving and donating later (if you have donations greater than, say, $20,000). But I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s as good, right now, as CEA or CSER donations.<p></p><p>GiveWell would have been on the above list of contenders if their funding needs were greater. I think they&#x2019;re right to want to diversify their funding. But being the very best place to donate is a high bar, and donating to extend GW&#x2019;s reserves, when they already have GoodVentures as a fall-back, seems unlikely to me to be the best use of funds. Since their first blog post asking for donations, they&#x2019;ve already raised $250,000; I expect them to soon raise enough to cover next year&#x2019;s expenses.

I'm glad to see such self-examination taking place, but I'm also concerned that the essay did not attack some of the most serious issues I see in the effective altruist movement, so I've decided to write my own critique. Due to time constraints, this critique is short and incomplete. I've tried to bring up arguments that would make people feel uncomfortable and defensive; hopefully I've succeeded.</p><p>Briefly, here are some of the major issues I have with the effective altruism movement as it currently stands:</p><ul><li>Over-focus on “tried and true” and “default” options, which may both reduce actual impact and decrease exploration of new potentially high-value opportunities.</li><li>Over-confident claims coupled with insufficient background research.</li><li>Over-reliance on a small set of tools for assessing opportunities, which lead many to underestimate the value of things such as “flow-through” effects.</li></ul><p>The common theme here is a subtle underlying message that simple, shallow analyses can allow one to make high-impact career and giving choices, and divest one of the need to dig further. I doubt that anyone explicitly believes this, but I do believe that this theme comes out implicitly both in arguments people make and in actions people take.</p><p>Lest this essay give a mistaken impression to the casual reader, I should note that <strong>there are many exemplary effective altruists who I feel are mostly immune to the issues above</strong>; for instance, the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/\">GiveWell blog</a> does a very good job of warning against the first and third points above, and I would recommend anyone who isn't already to subscribe to it (and there are other examples that I'm failing to mention). But for the purposes of this essay, I will ignore this fact except for the current caveat.</p><h3><strong>Over-focus on \"tried and true\" options</strong></h3><p>It seems to me that the effective altruist movement over-focuses on “tried and true” options, both in giving opportunities and in career paths. Perhaps the biggest example of this is the prevalence of “earning to give”. While this is certainly an admirable option, it should be considered as a baseline to improve upon, not a definitive answer.</p><p>The biggest issue with the “earning to give” path is that careers in finance and software (the two most common avenues for this) are incredibly straight-forward and secure. The two things that finance and software have in common is that there is a well-defined application process similar to the one for undergraduate admissions, and given reasonable job performance one will continue to be given promotions and raises (this probably entails working hard, but the end result is still rarely in doubt). One also gets a constant source of extrinsic positive reinforcement from the money they earn. Why do I call these things an “issue”? Because I think that these attributes encourage people to pursue these paths without looking for less obvious, less certain, but ultimately better paths. <a href=\"http://yaledailynews.com/weekend/2011/09/30/even-artichokes-have-doubts/\">One in six Yale graduates go into finance and consulting</a>, seemingly due to the simplicity of applying and the easy supply of extrinsic motivation. My intuition is that this ratio is higher than an optimal society would have, even if such people commonly gave generously (and it is certainly much higher than the number of people who <i>enter</i> college planning to pursue such paths).</p><p>Contrast this with, for instance, working at a start-up. Most start-ups are low-impact, but it is undeniable that at least some have been extraordinarily high-impact, so this seems like an area that effective altruists should be considering strongly. Why aren't there more of us at 23&amp;me, or Coursera, or Quora, or Stripe? I think it is because these opportunities are less obvious and take more work to find, once you start working it often isn't clear whether what you're doing will have a positive impact or not, and your future job security is massively uncertain. There are few sources of extrinsic motivation in such a career: perhaps more so at one of the companies mentioned above, which are reasonably established and have customers, but what about the 4-person start-up teams working in a warehouse somewhere? Some of them will go on to do great things but right now their lives must be full of anxiousness and uncertainty.</p><p>I don't mean to fetishize start-ups. They are just one well-known example of a potentially high-value career path that, to me, seems underexplored within the EA movement. I would argue (perhaps self-servingly) that academia is another example of such a path, with similar psychological obstacles: every 5 years or so you have the opportunity to get kicked out (e.g. applying for faculty jobs, and being up for tenure), you need to relocate regularly, few people will read your work and even fewer will praise it, and it won't be clear whether it had a positive impact until many years down the road. And beyond the “obvious” alternatives of start-ups and academia, what of the paths that haven't been created yet? GiveWell was revolutionary when it came about. Who will be the next GiveWell? And by this I don't mean the next charity evaluator, but the next set of people who fundamentally alter how we view altruism.</p><h3><strong>Over-confident claims coupled with insufficient background research</strong></h3><p>The history of effective altruism is littered with over-confident claims, many of which have later turned out to be false. In 2009, Peter Singer claimed that you could save a life for $200 (and many others repeated his claim). While the number was already questionable at the time, by 2011 we discovered that the number was completely off. Now new numbers were thrown around: from numbers still in the hundreds of dollars (GWWC's estimate for SCI, which was later shown to be flawed) up to $1600 (GiveWell's estimate for AMF, which GiveWell itself expected to go up, and which indeed did go up). These numbers were often cited without caveats, as well as other claims such as that the effectiveness of charities can vary by a factor of 1,000. How many people citing these numbers understood the process that generated them, or the high degree of uncertainty surrounding them, or the inaccuracy of past estimates? How many would have pointed out that saying that charities vary by a factor of 1,000 in effectiveness is by itself not very helpful, and is more a statement about how bad the bottom end is than how good the top end is?</p><p>More problematic than the careless bandying of numbers is the tendency toward not doing strong background research. A common pattern I see is: an effective altruist makes a bold claim, then when pressed on it offers a heuristic justification together with the claim that “<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have\">estimation is the best we have</a>”. This sort of argument acts as a conversation-stopper (and can also be quite annoying, which may be part of what drives some people away from effective altruism). In many of these cases, there are relatively easy opportunities to do background reading to further educate oneself about the claim being made. It can appear to an outside observer as though people are opting for the fun, easy activity (speculation) rather than the harder and more worthwhile activity (research). Again, I'm not claiming that this is people's explicit thought process, but it does seem to be what ends up happening.</p><p>Why haven't more EAs signed up for a course on global security, or tried to understand how DARPA funds projects, or learned about third-world health? I've heard claims that this would be too time-consuming relative to the value it provides, but this seems like a poor excuse if we want to be taken seriously as a movement (or even just want to reach consistently accurate conclusions about the world).</p><h3><strong>Over-reliance on a small set of tools</strong></h3><p>Effective altruists tend to have a lot of interest in quantitative estimates. We want to know what the best thing to do is, and we want a numerical value. This causes us to rely on scientific studies, economic reports, and Fermi estimates. It can cause us to underweight things like the competence of a particular organization, the strength of the people involved, and other “intangibles” (which are often not actually intangible but simply difficult to assign a number to). It also can cause us to over-focus on money as a unit of altruism, while often-times “it isn't about the money”: it's about doing the groundwork that no one is doing, or finding the opportunity that no one has found yet.</p><p>Quantitative estimates often also tend to ignore <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>: effects which are an indirect, rather than direct, result of an action (such as decreased disease in the third world contributing in the long run to increased global security). These effects are difficult to quantify but human and cultural intuition can do a reasonable job of taking them into account. As such, I often worry that effective altruists may actually be less effective than “normal” altruists. (One can point to all sorts of examples of farcical charities to claim that regular altruism sucks, but this misses the point that there are also amazing organizations out there, such as the <a href=\"https://www.simonsfoundation.org/\">Simons Foundation</a> or <a href=\"http://www.hhmi.org/\">HHMI</a>, which are doing enormous amounts of good despite not subscribing to the EA philosophy.)</p><p>What's particularly worrisome is that even if we were less effective than normal altruists, we would probably still end up looking better by our own standards, which explicitly fail to account for the ways in which normal altruists might outperform us (see above). This is a problem with any paradigm, but the fact that the effective altruist community is small and insular and relies heavily on its paradigm makes us far more susceptible to it.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"sSZ8pCvackwaY9vBx":2},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":2,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000074,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:35:22.911Z","name":"Criticism of effective altruism","slug":"criticism-of-effective-altruism","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Criticism of effective altruism</strong> collects critical discussion of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/effective-altruism\">effective altruism</a> ideas (as opposed to criticism of effective altruist <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-organizations\">organizations </a>or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-causes\">causes</a>, or the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-the-effective-altruism-community\">effective altruism community</a>).</p><h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2><p>Kuhn, Ben (2013) <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique/\">A critique of effective altruism</a>, <i>Ben Kuhn’s Blog</i>, December 2.</p><p>McMahan, Jeff (2016) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5840/tpm20167379\">Philosophical critiques of effective altruism</a>, <i>The Philosophers’ Magazine</i>, vol. 73, pp. 92–99.</p><p>Nielsen, Michael (2022) <a href=\"https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/\">Notes on effective altruism</a>, <i>Michael’s Notebook</i>, June 2.</p><p>Rowe, Abraham (2022) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/n3WwTz4dbktYwNQ2j/critiques-of-ea-that-i-want-to-read\">Critiques of EA that I want to read</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>, June 19.</p><p>Wiblin, Robert &amp; Keiran Harris (2019) <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/vitalik-buterin-new-ways-to-fund-public-goods/\">Vitalik Buterin on effective altruism, better ways to fund public goods, the blockchain’s problems so far, and how it could yet change the world</a>, <i>80,000 Hours</i>, September 3.</p><p>Zhang, Linchuan (2021) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pxALB46SEkwNbfiNS/the-motivated-reasoning-critique-of-effective-altruism\">The motivated reasoning critique of effective altruism</a>, <i>Effective Altruism Forum</i>, September 14.</p><h2 id=\"Related_entries\">Related entries</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-causes\">criticism of effective altruist causes</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-effective-altruist-organizations\">criticism of effective altruist organizations</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/criticism-of-the-effective-altruism-community\">criticism of the effective altruism community</a> |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/criticism-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk-studies\">criticism of longtermism and existential risk studies</a><strong> | </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism\">effective altruism</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/red-teaming\">red teaming</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/scalably-using-labour\">scalably using labour</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/social-and-intellectual-movements\">social and intellectual movements</a> | <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/working-at-ea-vs-non-ea-orgs\">working at EA vs non-EA orgs</a></p>","postCount":189,"lastVisitedAt":null,"_id":"sSZ8pCvackwaY9vBx"}]},{"_id":"bZ8w8ffdHRZpGLPKu","postedAt":"2014-01-07T13:34:35.536Z","modifiedAt":"2021-09-28T18:58:24.045Z","title":"Exploring Life Sciences Funding","question":false,"meta":false,"lastCommentedAt":"2014-01-07T13:34:35.536Z","pageUrl":"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bZ8w8ffdHRZpGLPKu/exploring-life-sciences-funding","htmlBody":"<p><i>Note: The Open Philanthropy Project was </i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/open-philanthropy-project-formerly-givewell-labs\"><i>formerly known as GiveWell Labs</i></a><i>.

Dario is currently a <a href=\"http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Dario_Amodei/\">postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford Medical School</a> studying proteomics; he is a recipient of the <a href=\"https://www.hertzfoundation.org/dx/fellows/fellow_profile.aspx?d=11149\">Hertz Fellowship</a> and winner of the Hertz Foundation’s <a href=\"http://www.hertzfoundation.org/dx/newsevents/pressrelease.aspx?d=192\">2012 Thesis prize</a> for his Ph.D. dissertation in the field of neuroscience. He is also a longtime GiveWell fan and supporter (see his <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/06/03/my-donation-for-2009-guest-post-from-dario-amodei/\">2009 guest post on the GiveWell blog</a>), and the two of us have been housemates since GiveWell <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/02/08/givewells-progress-in-2012/\">relocated to San Francisco</a>.</p><p>For the early stages of investigation, Dario has served as our informal scientific advisor,<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/exploring-life-sciences-funding#Footnote\">*</a> guiding our investigation by recommending readings, offering connections, etc. I feel that he has been a good fit for this role because he combines experience as a scientist with an extremely strong understanding of GiveWell’s values and goals, and is highly accessible to us. We’ve come to believe that in the early stages of an investigation, when we often don’t know which questions to ask, the ability to have extended, repeated, friendly, low-stakes interactions to get “grounded in the basics” is crucial, and we’ve taken a similar approach to exploring policy advocacy (which we wrote about previously).</p><p>Under Dario’s guidance, I have:</p><ul><li><strong>Conducted a series of interviews with representatives of major life sciences funders</strong> including <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Howard%20Hughes%20Medical%20Institute%2006-03-13.pdf\">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> (the largest private philanthropic funder of scientific research in the U.S.), <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Wellcome%20Trust%2006-25-13%20(public).pdf\">Wellcome Trust</a> (the largest private philanthropic funder of life sciences in the U.K., with similar scale to Howard Hughes and to the British government’s research funding), and the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Carolyn%20Bruzdzinski%20July%2031,%202013%20(public).pdf\">American Cancer Society</a>. (We have also had several other off-the-record conversations, including with U.S. government staff.)</li><li><strong>Studied a small amount of the basics of cell biology.</strong> Specifically, I read chapters 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 18 and 20 from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008ZJKVWA/ref=pe_245070_24466410_M1T1DP\">Essential Cell Biology</a>; reviewed the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Biology-Cell-Edition-ebook/dp/B0089NVFRM/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377907748&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=cell+biology+bruce+alberts\">more detailed version</a> of chapter 7; and questioned Dario about them at length. The two of us also discussed the abstracts of several NIH grant proposals and <i>Nature</i> papers. The goal here was simply to improve my basic comprehension of common terms used in discussing life sciences; after the calls discussed above, he and I agreed that it was important for me to improve on this front.</li><li><strong>Taken opportunities to attend larger meetings of scientists in appropriate settings</strong>: relatively low-stakes settings in which communication in layperson’s terms was encouraged. I attended a meeting at the <a href=\"http://www.cshl.edu/banbury/\">Banbury Center</a>, intended to bring together people with different areas of expertise to discuss possible approaches to oncology; a meeting organized by <a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\">Good Ventures</a> (with Dario’s help) to discuss potential prizes in science; and several meetings of <a href=\"http://vannevargroup.org/\">Vannevar Group</a>. All of these meetings were organized by Dario or people in his network.</li></ul><h1>Several perspectives on giving opportunities aiming at furthering progress in life sciences</h1><p>One natural way to look for underfunded opportunities is to focus on the question of “what diseases and conditions should be getting more focus and funding?” It’s possible that some diseases and conditions are overlooked because they primarily affect people in the developing world (for example, malaria and tuberculosis); it’s possible that some are overlooked because they don’t have the same sorts of interest groups behind them (for example, chronic pain and other symptoms of aging, which have no analogue to groups like <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/\">American Cancer Society</a>). Prior to starting this investigation, this was the main framework we were thinking about for finding overlooked giving opportunities, and we believe there may be a lot of potential in thinking in this way.</p><p>However, the interviews we’ve done so far have led us to believe that this is far from the only - and may not be the best - framework for thinking about “what sorts of science are underfunded.” Much scientific research - including many of the discoveries that have been associated with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physiology_or_Medicine\">Nobel Prize</a> - is not clearly associated with a particular disease or condition at all. Conversely, it’s possible that funding officially directed toward a particular disease or condition is instead used for work with more general ambitions. Thinking about “which disease and condition should be targeted” is a natural framework for humanitarian-oriented non-scientists, but it isn’t necessarily the most natural way of dividing up different types of science from a scientist’s perspective.</p><p>The interviews we’ve done so far have included several criticisms of the primary existing science funding mechanisms, particularly those of the <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. The NIH provides <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/attachments/Research%20Funding%20Data%20from%20WebCaspar.xls\">over half of all U.S. funding in life sciences</a>, and <a href=\"http://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/charts/Default.aspx?chartId=33&amp;catId=2\">about half of all NIH funding</a> is via a particular grant mechanism, called the R01. The R01, and the NIH more broadly, is perceived as a major factor in researchers’ incentives, and observations about “what the science world needs more of” seem closely connected with critiques of the NIH and the R01. I refer to the NIH, and particularly the R01, as “the existing” system in the bullet points below, listing some of the claims discussed in our interviews:</p><ul><li><strong>The existing system favors researchers with strong track records, and is not good at supporting young investigators</strong>. This was the most commonly raised concern, and is mentioned in all three of our public interviews.</li><li><strong>The existing system favors a particular brand of research - generally incremental testing of particular hypotheses - and is less suited to supporting research that doesn’t fit into this mold.</strong> Research that doesn’t fit into this mold may include:<ul><li>Very high-risk research representing a small chance of a big breakthrough.</li><li>Research that focuses on developing improved tools and techniques (for example, better microscopy or better genome sequencing), rather than on directly investigating particular hypotheses.</li><li>“Translational research” aiming to improve the transition between basic scientific discoveries and clinical applications, and not focused on traditionally “academic” topics (for example, research focusing on predicting drug toxicity).</li></ul></li><li><strong>The existing system focuses on time-consuming, paperwork-heavy grant applications for individual investigators; more attention to differently structured grants and grant applications would be welcome.</strong> These could include mechanisms focused on providing small amounts of funding, along with feedback on ideas, quickly and with minimal paperwork, as well as mechanisms focused on supporting larger-scale projects that require collaboration between multiple investigators.</li></ul><p>We don’t yet endorse any of these claims, and we’re aware that in many cases the NIH has mechanisms that intend to address alleged shortcomings. In order to assess these claims, we feel that we would need staff and/or advisors with substantial technical knowledge, as discussed in the next section.</p><h1>The centrality of scientific advisors</h1><p>The basic approach we’re <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/refining-goals-givewell-labs\">picturing for GiveWell Labs</a> runs roughly as follows:</p><ol><li>Generalist GiveWell staff (everyone we currently employ should be thought of as a generalist) gather information on many different causes, through methods including interviewing those with relevant expertise, and seek to understand different causes’ importance, tractability, and “crowdedness” at a high level.</li><li>For particularly promising causes, GiveWell will consider hiring staff to specialize in these causes (or recommending that major philanthropists hire staff for this purpose), since we believe that <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/refining-goals-givewell-labs\">having the appropriate amount of context to evaluate giving opportunities in a cause may take in excess of a year</a> (even with good access to relevant experts).</li><li>Generalist staff will be responsible for evaluating cause-specific staff; cause-specific staff will be responsible for synthesizing expert opinion and other information to make giving recommendations. However, when investigating scientific research, we believe that another link in the chain is needed. We believe that we need <strong>generalist scientific advisors</strong> in order to evaluate and compare different approaches to scientific funding at a high level. This is because, based on the early investigation detailed above, I don’t feel positioned even to understand the <i>meaning</i> - much less the plausibility - of many key claims. For example, in order to evaluate the claim that “high-risk” research is under-invested in, I’d want to be able to distinguish high-risk from lower-risk research and be able to assess how much is invested in each - something that I believe is likely to require substantial technically informed judgment calls. To some degree, this dynamic holds for any cause. In any field, there will be people whose greater experience makes subtle contributions to how they see many debates and evaluate many interventions. But scientific research is distinguished from other fields I’ve investigated by the degree to which expertise (often in the form of understanding a very specific, near-universal knowledge base that requires extended study to absorb) is a prerequisite to understanding the basics of what people are claiming and how one might reasonably go about comparing and drilling down on claims. Therefore, we chose to <strong>pause further investigation of scientific research until we recruit an appropriate set of generalist scientific advisors</strong>. (We have very recently - as of this week - formed a few new advisory relationships and restarted research.)</li></ol><h1>What we’re looking for in generalist scientific advisors</h1><p>What follows is a draft spec that we have started to circulate in search of generalist scientific advisors. We plan to distribute it both within our network and more broadly, and initially Dario and I are evaluating candidates based on scientific aptitude and accomplishments (Dario and his network assess this) and fit with GiveWell (I assess this). So far, we have circulated this spec informally and found a few advisors we are working with on a trial basis; yesterday we started distributing the spec more broadly.</p><h2>About us</h2><p>GiveWell (<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">www.givewell.org</a>) finds outstanding giving opportunities and publishes the full details of its analysis to help donors decide where to give. It has historically focused on direct aid, but is now exploring the idea of funding (via recommendation) scientific research. GiveWell works as an advisor to Good Ventures (<a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\">www.goodventures.org</a>), a foundation funded by Dustin Moskovitz (co-founder of Facebook and, more recently, Asana) and run by Cari Tuna.</p><p>GiveWell’s ultimate goal is to accomplish humanitarian good, but it believes that some of the most beneficial scientific breakthroughs will come via long-term, high-risk fundamental research and is highly open to promoting work in this category.</p><p>GiveWell is not limited to any particular field, disease, biological condition, or population. We seek to broadly consider and identify the approaches that are most (a) promising and (b) under-invested in by other funders. We are likely to focus initially on life sciences (though this will include other areas with applications to life sciences, e.g., novel measurement platforms), but intend to explore other areas as well. We are seeking both advisors with backgrounds in life sciences and/or physical sciences who think strategically about future implications of fundamental research, with an eye to long-term, transformative impact.</p><p>GiveWell seeks scientists who are deeply experienced and (depending on career stage) accomplished, and who are committed to identifying the most promising science, regardless of how unconventional it may be. GiveWell hopes to find opportunities that are potentially transformative, and appear after substantial scrutiny (by world-class scientists) to represent intelligent (if sometimes risky) philanthropic investments.</p><h2>The role</h2><p>Generalist scientific advisors will help GiveWell find the best opportunities for a funder to accomplish good - whether it takes the form of pursuing short-term, cost-effective research with direct humanitarian applications, or pursuing long-term, fundamental research aiming for breakthroughs with wide-reaching and difficult-to-predict applications. Activities may include:</p><ul><li>Interviewing other funders’ staff and scientific advisors to evaluate different approaches to research funding.</li><li>Finding, interviewing, and evaluating scientists doing particularly promising work.</li><li>Assessing (via literature review, interviews, etc.) the tractability of particular scientific goals and the likely future progress of particular fields</li><li>Seeking out, and presenting arguments regarding, inefficiencies in the current infrastructure for funding scientific research</li></ul><p>GiveWell expects advisors to serve on a part-time basis, with significant variability in time commitment from week to week. In our early stages, we will likely seek to work with advisors on a trial basis, without long-term commitments. GiveWell’s staff will provide support (scheduling, documentation, etc.) as appropriate.</p><h2>The team</h2><p>We expect initially to retain 5-10 scientific advisors, at a variety of career stages (potentially ranging from junior faculty or even postdoctoral fellows to very senior scientists). We are interested in advisors from both academia and industry. This team will interact with each other regularly and bring diverse perspectives to the questions we’re asking. These will not be the only scientists we work with, but they will be the team of “generalists” that has primary responsibility for broad, comparative analysis identifying particularly promising areas and people to invest in.</p><h2>Qualifications</h2><ul><li>Strong scientific accomplishments for one’s career stage.</li><li>Technical intelligence, as assessed by both track record and by interviews (with scientists we retain for interviewing).</li><li>Breadth of interests and abilities. Generalist scientific advisors should be interested in - and good at - comparatively assessing science and scientists in a broad variety of fields.</li><li>Willingness and ability to think critically and strategically but unconventionally, in order to find the ways in which existing funding infrastructure for science falls short of its potential.</li><li>Deep and broad network of high-quality scientific colleagues with whom the advisor may consult for specific technical expertise as needed to assess opportunities.</li><li>Willingness and ability to communicate one’s views to non-technical people, and technical experts outside one’s own scientific field.</li><li>Interest in assessing the potential connection between scientific progress and humanitarian progress, both over the short and long run.</li></ul><p>This is an opportunity to influence the scientific priorities of a potentially major source of funds whose focus is on humanitarian good accomplished, without pre-commitments to particular fields, diseases, conditions, or populations. We are seeking people who are excited by the opportunity to have this influence, passionate about finding opportunities for scientific funders to accomplish good, and accordingly prepared to accept compensation that is reasonable but below what they could earn consulting for for-profit organizations.</p><p>* We’ve recently started paying Dario for work that is focused on GiveWell’s priorities. These expenses have fallen under the heading of “independent research contractors,” which are covered by a specially earmarked grant from <a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\">Good Ventures</a>.</p>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"toct8RYvTvgontEts":1,"aRLDYMuyWpq7r6pST":1},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":2,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000076,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-12-22T14:44:38.117Z","name":"Open Philanthropy","slug":"open-philanthropy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> (previously the <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>) is a research and grantmaking foundation based in San Francisco.</p><h2 id=\"History\">History</h2><p>Open Philanthropy launched in late 2011, as a partnership between <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/good-ventures\">Good Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell\">GiveWell</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftgc02qi0fmg\"><sup><a href=\"#fntgc02qi0fmg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The partnership operated under the name <strong>GiveWell Labs</strong> before adopting, in August 2014, the name <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4vww1w7m4ep\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4vww1w7m4ep\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It continued to be part of GiveWell until 2017, when it became an independent organization.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh926zy6ps5f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh926zy6ps5f\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The name was changed to <strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> around December 2019.</p><h2 id=\"Leadership\">Leadership</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/cari-tuna\">Cari Tuna</a> is Open Philanthropy's president, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/holden-karnofsky\">Holden Karnofsky</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/alexander-berger\">Alexander Berger</a> are its two co-CEOs.

At this point, I believe that there is <strong>very little in the way of academic literature that can shed light on this question</strong>. I’ve put together some very limited and preliminary analysis; to produce something better, I’d want to work with both <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/exploring-life-sciences-funding\">generalist scientific advisors</a> and at least one economist.</p><h1>Existing literature</h1><p>In order to assess the existing literature on returns to life sciences funding, we have:</p><ul><li>Examined a <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w15622\">review of economic literature on measuring the returns to R&amp;D in general</a> (Hall, Mairesse and Mohnon 2009) and some of the papers it references. The literature discussed in this review tends to focus on <i>private industry R&amp;D</i>, and does not appear highly relevant to the question we’re focused on.</li><li>Examined a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83123/\">review of literature on “the impact of publicly funded and biomedical research”</a> (Sampat 2011) and some of the papers it references, and <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Bhaven%20Sampat%2005-02-13%20(public).pdf\">spoken to the author</a>.</li><li>Read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Gains-Medical-Research-Economic/dp/0226551784\">Measuring the Gains from Medical Research: An Economic Approach</a>, spoken briefly with one of the authors, and spoken with <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/conversations/Philipson%209-4-13%20(public).pdf\">another economist he referred us to</a>.</li></ul><p>Our takeaways on the relevance of this literature for our purposes:</p><ul><li>Some research focuses on the role that general scientific research and technology innovation has played in reductions in the burden of disease, and generally concludes that it has played a major role (see, in particular, Chapter 4 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Gains-Medical-Research-Economic/dp/0226551784\">Measuring the Gains from Medical Research: An Economic Approach</a>, which discusses heart disease, and <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/fhecpo/v13y2010i2n1.html\">The Contributions of Improved Therapy and Earlier Detection to Cancer Survival Gains, 1988-2000</a> which discusses cancer).</li><li>Some research attempts to disentangle the roles of publicly and privately funded research, and otherwise isolate which kind of research has been responsible for humanitarian gains (and on what timescales); we haven’t found this work compelling.</li><li>Some research attempts to quantify the economic value of past reductions in disease burden, and juxtapose it with the amount the U.S. spends on public research (without directly estimating how much of the reduction is due to public research). This research generally concludes that benefits are significant and far outweigh the costs. For example, chapter 1 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Measuring-Gains-Medical-Research-Economic/dp/0226551784\">Measuring the Gains from Medical Research: An Economic Approach</a> argues that the value of improved life expectancy over the last ~100 years (monetized using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life\">value of a statistical life framework</a>) is comparable to total measured GDP growth over that time; chapter 2 estimates that gains from 1970-2000 were worth about $46 trillion total, net of increased spending on health care, as against an NIH budget of ~$35 billion per year as of 1995.</li><li>Overall, relatively little has been done in this area, and we haven’t found any research that attempts to (a) make forward-looking estimates of the likely future returns to investments in life sciences; (b) estimate the value of the marginal (as opposed to average) dollar spent on research.</li></ul><h1>An extremely rough forward-looking cost-effectiveness analysis for cancer research</h1><p>I created a rough forward-looking cost-effectiveness analysis for cancer research, in order to start thinking through what a more sophisticated analysis would look like. The analysis is available <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au4TwA4jU4bfdEhnb3BZdWxIREpKckxIeFI1d19TZ1E#gid=0\">here</a>. Note that:</p><ul><li>I chose to focus on cancer because (a) most of the burden is via mortality rather than morbidity, and I believe mortality statistics to be generally easier to access and verify than morbidity statistics; (b) because cancer is a politically popular disease for research funding, it’s likely that the “official” cancer budget of the NIH is a reasonable proxy for - or perhaps overestimate of - how much is being spent on cancer research. (By contrast, if I focused on a less politically salient disease, I’d worry that I was substantially undercounting the funding directed toward it, as funding that was officially earmarked for more popular diseases could effectively be financing highly relevant research. In the case of cancer, while I expect some research outside the National Cancer Institute to be relevant to cancer, I also expect some National Cancer Institute research to be highly relevant to other diseases, and I think it is not unreasonable to think of the National Cancer Institute budget as approximating the “costs of scientific progress on cancer.”)</li><li>I would guess that cancer research produces less benefit per dollar spent than research in many other categories, partly because I perceive cancer as having a relatively large amount of interest from funders.</li><li>This estimate applies only to the average, not marginal, dollar of research funding.</li><li>I’ve estimated the “future reductions in the burden of cancer attributable to publicly financed research” at 50% based on <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/exploring-life-sciences-funding\">Dario’s</a> input and some checking of whether this would be consistent with past reductions in the burden of cancer (more in the spreadsheet).</li><li>I’ve only considered the National Cancer Institute budget; I haven’t considered private philanthropic funding, overseas funding, private R&amp;D costs or potential increased health care costs (though it’s possible that stronger progress on the basic science of cancer could lead to <i>lower</i> R&amp;D costs and health care costs, if it leads to drugs with stronger and easier-to-prove effects).</li><li>I’ve only considered the U.S. burden of cancer, not the global burden.</li><li>I’ve only considered mortality, not morbidity.</li></ul><p>The estimate is ~$2800 per life-year, which is substantially worse than our <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets#HowcosteffectiveisLLINdistribution\">estimate of ~$80/DALY for LLIN distribution</a>, but not so much worse as to make it implausible that well-directed scientific research (as opposed to “the average dollar spent on cancer research”) could have greater (even substantially greater) benefits. In order to create a better estimate down the line, I would want to:</p><ul><li>Focus in on a particular kind of highly promising research, to the extent possible, and attempt to focus on the future impact of the marginal rather than average dollar. This would require views about <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/exploring-life-sciences-funding\">the best opportunities within life sciences funding</a> and their possible product, of the kind that would require substantial input from scientists.</li><li>Take private philanthropic, industry, and international funding into account; have a more sophisticated picture both of which funding to count as being “toward” the goal in question.</li><li>Take the international burden of disease into account, and include morbidity as well as mortality.</li></ul>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"toct8RYvTvgontEts":1,"aRLDYMuyWpq7r6pST":1},"voteCount":1,"baseScore":2,"extendedScore":null,"score":0.000076,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-12-22T14:44:38.117Z","name":"Open Philanthropy","slug":"open-philanthropy","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p><strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> (previously the <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>) is a research and grantmaking foundation based in San Francisco.</p><h2 id=\"History\">History</h2><p>Open Philanthropy launched in late 2011, as a partnership between <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/good-ventures\">Good Ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell\">GiveWell</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftgc02qi0fmg\"><sup><a href=\"#fntgc02qi0fmg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The partnership operated under the name <strong>GiveWell Labs</strong> before adopting, in August 2014, the name <strong>Open Philanthropy Project</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4vww1w7m4ep\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4vww1w7m4ep\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It continued to be part of GiveWell until 2017, when it became an independent organization.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh926zy6ps5f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh926zy6ps5f\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The name was changed to <strong>Open Philanthropy</strong> around December 2019.</p><h2 id=\"Leadership\">Leadership</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/cari-tuna\">Cari Tuna</a> is Open Philanthropy's president, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/holden-karnofsky\">Holden Karnofsky</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/alexander-berger\">Alexander Berger</a> are its two co-CEOs.

This post is a collection of my notes on the changes, mostly focusing on the cost-effectiveness estimates.A year ago I put a lot of hours into understanding the cost-effectiveness calculations for deworming and cash transfers, the results of which I wrote up in <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/01/23/guest-post-from-david-barry-about-deworming-cost-effectiveness/\">this post</a>. I had planned to make this a fairly short post, merely indicating the important changes from last year, but I ended up going into a bit of detail (it&apos;s still a lot shorter than last year&apos;s).Before I get into all that, a few preliminaries:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> distributes insecticide-treated bednets; the primary benefit is preventing child deaths from malaria. I think of its effectiveness in units of dollars per (statistical) life saved.</li>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> (SCI) funds and helps to implement mass deworming programmes. The <a href=\"http://www.dewormtheworld.org/\">Deworm the World Initiative</a> (DtWI) encourages governments to implement mass deworming programmes. The primary benefits from deworming school-aged children are that they grow into healthier, stronger adults, and are more productive in adulthood. (A secondary benefit comes from improving the health of worm-infected children in the short-term.) I think of the benefits in units of &quot;proportional increase in (discounted) adult consumption relative to income, per donated dollar&quot;.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> transfer cash to poor households in Kenya and Uganda. Some of this money is consumed, some is invested; the benefit is in units of &quot;proportional increase in (discounted) consumption relative to income, per donated dollar&quot;.</li>\n</ul>\nI use the following approximate equivalences (your mileage may vary!):\n<ul>\n\t<li>1 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year\">DALY</a> averted is equivalent to consumption of 3 times annual income;</li>\n\t<li>1 statistical life saved by bednets is equivalent to 34 DALY&apos;s averted.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is a little silly to be so precise as to say &quot;34&quot; DALY&apos;s and in my head I usually round to 30. I only wrote 34 above so that it&apos;s consistent with a discount rate of 1.7% &#x2013; I use that discount rate because that&apos;s roughly around where I feel it should be.\n<h2>Against Malaria Foundation</h2>\nGiveWell (perhaps only temporarily) removed AMF from its recommended charities because they don&apos;t think that AMF has room for more funding. I can&apos;t comment particularly usefully on this topic; those who want the details can read <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">this post</a> on the GiveWell blog. The important question is whether or not AMF will be able to secure agreements for large net distributions with one or more governments. If they can&apos;t, then they won&apos;t be able to spend the money directed to them via GiveWell as fast as it comes in. If they can&apos;t, it won&apos;t be so bad &#x2013; the money donated will be spent well, it just won&apos;t be spent for a while.<p></p><p>My subjective guess is that the probability of AMF securing an agreement for a large net distribution is high enough to warrant continuing donating to them.</p><p>It is also important note some changes to GiveWell&apos;s assessment of bednet distributions. The rather surprising headline figure is a cost per life saved of $3400 (using average costs) or $3200 (using marginal costs). This is up almost $1000 from last year. The changes come from an increase in average net costs ($5.54 to $6.13) and the introduction of a fudge factor to take into account mosquito resistance to the insecticides used to treat the nets. GiveWell subjectively estimate this factor at 80% (so that cost per life saved is multiplied by 1/0.8 = 1.25).</p><p>I don&apos;t have much of a feel for what this number should be. On the one hand, the resistance seems to develop over a number of years, it&apos;s been sporadically monitored for a while, resistance on <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets/insecticide-resistance-malaria-control\">the map here</a> is defined at at least 20% mosquito survival, and there are plenty of dots on the map which don&apos;t show such levels of resistance. On the other hand, I was reading a report a few weeks ago (I forget which one) on this topic and it was dispiriting. On balance, I feel that 80% is being a little too pessimistic for the time being, and I&apos;ll round down GiveWell&apos;s $3400 figure to $3000, while hoping that a properly effective vaccine will eventually render this problem moot.\n</p><h2>Deworming</h2>\nThis calculation remains horrendously convoluted.<p></p><p>The same host of subjective adjustment factors are present in this year&apos;s calculation &#x2013; the results rely on a study that was run in an area with particularly high levels of worm infection, and there&apos;s some disagreement in the literature over how effective mass deworming programmes are (as opposed to more targeted deworming treatment). For the most part I am happy with the range of subjective guesses I used last year. An important not-so-subjective change is SCI&apos;s cost per treatment, up from $0.51 to somewhere between $0.72 and $1.13. The GiveWell staff use $0.99 as their best guess, but their <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">SCI review</a> describes this value as &quot;conservative&quot;, and I&apos;d be happier with a figure closer to $0.72. I&apos;ve used $0.80 as my input into the spreadsheet.</p><p>GiveWell have tidied up the calculation in one place &#x2013; last year it was assumed (at least implicitly) that all benefits from deworming, both developmental and short-term, came from giving the treatment to children. This year the short-term health benefits to adults are included. This gives a non-trivial boost to the overall cost-effectiveness, almost cancelling out the effect of the increase in estimated cost per treatment.</p><p>GiveWell&apos;s spreadsheet has a &quot;Prevalence/intensity adjustment - SCI&quot; input, set to 66.67%. This is new; last year I argued that this should be incorporated into the external validity adjustment, so I&apos;m happy to see it there (though I set it to 100% and use the same external validity adjustment as I did last year).</p><p>Putting it all together, my preferred inputs say that a donated dollar to SCI increases discounted consumption for one person by 1.4% of annual income, down from my best guess of 1.7% last year. By the equivalences I listed at the start, that equates to a cost per life-saved-equivalent of $7000.</p><p>DtWI&apos;s advocacy efforts are so hard to quantify that I will ignore the cost-effectiveness calculation for it.\n</p><h2>Cash transfers</h2>\nThe cost-effectiveness of cash transfers depends on the percentage of the transfers that get invested, and the return on those investments. Last year I followed the GiveWell staff and estimated that 75% of GiveDirectly&apos;s cash transfers would be invested, and assumed an ROI of 25%.<p></p><p>This year, the GiveWell staff mostly estimate 50% rate of investment and a 15% ROI. The rate of investment is lower than what is reported in GiveDirectly surveys (around 70%), and comes from somewhere in a jumble of econometric tables that I couldn&apos;t be bothered deciphering.</p><p>The ROI of 15% is estimated from the ROI from buying an iron roof, the most commonly-mentioned large investment made by GiveDirectly recipients. Reported ROI&apos;s for the iron rooves range from 7% to 23%, so the figure of 15% seems reasonable.</p><p>The result is that a donated dollar increases discounted consumption by 0.57%, down from my best guess of 0.96% last year. The 0.57% figure equates to a cost per life-saved equivalent of $18,000. (As was the case last year, I end up with cash transfers being more cost-effective than the GiveWell staff, because I use a lower discount rate than they do.)</p><p>That is a disappointingly high number, and it is worth reflecting on it for a bit. There have now been quite a few studies on various types of cash transfers, most of them finding much higher ROI&apos;s than 15%. GiveDirectly themselves apparently designed their plans around 25%. It is possible that as GD expands their programmes elsewhere, ROI&apos;s will improve; it&apos;s also possible (and this is what I suspect is more likely) that the fully hands-off approach by GD leads to lower returns than cash transfer programmes that put some conditions on the grants. (Of course the latter would require more overhead, but the differences in ROI are big.)</p><p>While I remain very positive about cash transfers, and so will continue to support GD as the leading cash transfer charity (I&apos;m also a huge fan of their randomised rollouts, which lets us have this sort of discussion at all; they also experiment with the design of their transfers, also worth supporting), I am a little less positive about GD than I used to be.\n</p><h2>GiveWell?</h2>\nGiveWell still <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/20/update-on-givewells-funding-needs/\">has a funding gap</a>. I&apos;ve seen people want to have discussions about the merits of donating to GiveWell directly, given that Good Ventures can fund them (the question is whether GiveWell should have a large, independent revenue source separate from GV), but I found it all very unsatisfying. It gets into the sort of governance issues that I really don&apos;t have a clue about.<p></p><p>I donated US$5000 to GiveWell today. I didn&apos;t overthink it, just made a decision.\n</p><h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>GiveWell&apos;s cost-effectiveness spreadsheet with my inputs for deworming and cash transfers (in the &apos;DB&apos; sheet) is <a href=\"http://pappubahry.com/charity/files/GiveWell_CEA_DB_deworming_cash_2013.xlsx\">here</a> (XLSX).</li>\n\t<li>Last year I had deworming as 1.7 times as cost-effective as cash transfers. This year I have it 2.5 times as cost-effective as GiveDirectly&apos;s cash transfers. All of these numbers are rubbery, of course, but it&apos;s enough for me to weight my giving more towards deworming this coming year.</li>\n\t<li>If we ignore the room-for-more-funding issue, AMF is an even more clear stand-out number 1 charity.</li>\n\t<li>There are strong arguments for delaying donations until the AMF situation becomes clearer. I suspect I will continue to support AMF at a reduced level this coming year. I&apos;d be uncomfortable if the effective altruist community just stopped donating for a while, so I think I will continue my regular donations, with SCI getting the greatest share.</li>\n\t<li>Current plan for 2013 donation splits: SCI 40, AMF 30, GD 20, DtWI 10. That&apos;ll probably change.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Crossposted from David Barry&apos;s <a href=\"http://pappubahry.livejournal.com/583528.html\">blog</a></em><p></p></body></html>","shortform":false,"tagRelevance":{"sWcuTyTB5dP3nas2t":1,"RRcLA4Kn8pasimQZr":1},"voteCount":0,"baseScore":0,"extendedScore":null,"score":0,"pingbacks":{},"tags":[{"createdAt":"2020-07-27T23:09:43.581Z","name":"Global health and development","slug":"global-health-and-development","descriptionHtmlWithToc":"<p>The <strong>global health and development</strong> tag can cover any post about improving public health, reducing poverty, or increasing economic growth; most of these posts will discuss the developing world, but this isn't strictly necessary.</p><p>In 2013, roughly 767 million people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 per day, adjusted for purchasing power.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefphn1q4i5kdb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnphn1q4i5kdb\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Lack of economic resources has direct consequences on many aspects of people’s lives, including access to education and healthcare.
